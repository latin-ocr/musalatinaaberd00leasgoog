ΟΝ HIS OWN GARDEN.

LXXII. ΟΝ HIS OWN GARDEN.

Probably allegorical, regarding his own library and literary avocatione

ARGUMENT.

Rivalling the gardens ol Alcinous, my orchards rise stately in the public
view. Even in gloorny winter's rage, I cull the fruits ol Punic land and
citrons of the Medes. Without the need ol takes and hocs, this garden
grows apples for its owner with no toil. ’‘ris a golden gaudeo, product
ol the golden age when things spontaneous came. This which you till
with iron and with dung is the product of the age ol dung and iron.

LXXII. DE HORTO SUO.

Aemula Phaeacum silvis, pomaria nobis
ln medio surgunt ambitiosa loro.

Hic tristis dum saevit hiems, quae Punica tellus,
Quaeque ferax mittit Media, poma lego.

Nil opus hic rastris durisve ligonibus, hortus
Hic domino nullo poma labore parit.

⁰ Aureus est hortus nobis, hunc protulit aetas
Aurea, qua fruetus sponte ferebat humus.
Hunc tibi vel ferro vel stercore nata dederunt
Saecula, quem ferro stercoribusque colis.

7. Hune] The editions by some error give hanc, which we venture to correct.
