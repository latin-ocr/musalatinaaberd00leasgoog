C. TUMULUS IOANNIS COLISSONII, PRAEFECTI
ABREDONENSIS.

Sancte Colissonio statuam deceme Senatus,
Hic ubi Praefectos conditur inter avos.

Dextra gerat gladium, geminas manus altera lances,
Hic statuae titulus, quem legat orbis, erit:

“ Vir saeclo, Saturne, tuo, Lacedaemone civis,
Romulea Consul dignus hic urbe fuit ’'.
