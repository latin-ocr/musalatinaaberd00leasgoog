DAUGHTER OF THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLY.

ARGUMENT.

Accept‚ royal maid, a wee dog and wee bitch, sent from the heights οἰ

Benachie, a present from Eliza. The female rejoices in a queen's name, the
male in a king’s; each is the pink of its sex. They are sleeker than violets
and whiter than privet flowers. Their baeles shine variegated with Paphien
roses. They were whelped by a biteh that inhabits the citadels of the sky,
now the glory of the stars, formerly companion of a virgin. Right happy is
the dam, when bidding Iarewell to earth she has won her way to elimb Jove’s
gleaming shrine. The tiny offspring surpasses the fortune of their darn, in
that they enter the gilded horne where you, Anne, reside. A noble pair, they
will romp with you in the shining hall, and from your feeding hand they will
nibble ambrosial tit-bits. As often as they give little growls, pretending to be
angry, 'twill be yours to stroke their silken baeles with snowy hand. Perhaps
they will dare to give kisses to rosy lips, or, if they are not so bold, you, divine
creature, will perhaps bestow them( Peradventure too they will, as brother
and sister, invade your lap, and will, each of them, in your soft bosom dare to
snore. Why did Jove lay aside his power divine and assume a swan's plumage
and the twisted homs of a seowlingbull? Should any of the celestials be
amorous, let him take the shape of Eliza's gista, if he aspires, 0 Anna, toa

nearer fruition of your lips.
