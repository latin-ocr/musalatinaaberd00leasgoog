EPIGRAMS.

[End os Epigrammata as published in “Daliliae '' (Ed. 1637).]

Ψ Here ends the group of the “Musae Aulicae‚'' ae also the series of
poenis, as contained in the Delitiae (1637), and published in Johnston’s lifetime.
Those now following, to CLI. inclusive, are contained in the Middelburg
edition as a continuation of the Epigrammata, and are, in their collected sorni,
posthumous publications, only some few of thern, and those chiefly dedicatione,
having appeared sporadically under the poet'e eye, before 1642.

CXXIX. TO MARY ERSKINE, THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS
COUNTESS MARISCHAL.

THE DEDICATION OF THE PSALMS.

In this poem Johnston hazarded a comparison with Buchanan’e gncehil lines to Quaen
Mary, which lorm the very pearl ol dedication poems; but although he could not win in euch
a case the prize, he has not lost hie due renown. The Countess Marischal, thus honoured, was
the spouse ol William, sixth Earl Marischal‚ and therefore the daughter-inlaw os the founder os
Marischal College. She was a daughter ol John, Earl ol Mar, the Lord High Treasurer, and
ol Many, daughter of Esne Stewart, first Dulce ol Lennox.

ARGUMENT.

Nymph, sole lady without a peer‚ froin Kings descended, thou shinest by
thine own light more than through thy noble race. Compared with thee one
may deem that Darne Eloquence is mute, that Juno laclrs dignity, Venus grows
dun, Minerva is rustic. Through thee the House of Keith enjoys an heir, who
outshines all of his own age, and, though yet a youth, equals his great fore·
fathers. 'Tis not lilre the Phrygian shepherd's gift the gift I offer, though
thyself alone excel without a contest the Goddesses three. Receive the sacred
songs with which the Holy Trinity, whose sacred flaine glows in thy breast,
inspired of old the shepherds of Solyma. Receive what therein is ours, thou
patroness of the poetic quire, to whom Helicon’s own streame are tributary.
My Muse, poor erewhile and ragged and ready to expire, will get dignity and
light and life from thee.
