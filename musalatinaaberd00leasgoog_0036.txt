'a 1111111111 xxvii

The other error concems the date of J0hnston’s return to Scotland from
1111 Continent Benson and Lauder put this down as 1632, and, although
David lrving saw-'that this murt be wrong, for he noticed that Thos. Dempster‚
who died in 1615,“111111111111111111111 had already returned [to Scot-
land] at the perjd when he himself [Dempster] wrote,'’ the error once
begun has held'its place in the Biographies. The evidence to he adduced
points to a muchearlier date for Johnston's return.

IomeE OF JOHNSTON'S BIRTH.

In investigating the first point, the birth date, suspicion was first aroused
by studying the print of Arthur Johnston’s countenance prefixed to the Middel-
111119Ε1111111.1 This print indicated the features of a 1111 well advanc'ed in
years, and certainly far beyhnd the age assigned to Johnston at his death;
for the inscription round thehim bears the words: “ 1639, Aetat. 52,¹' making
him 11117-111111111191111111111111111 in 1641, supposing him born in 1587.
That some confusion has got 11111111 dates is shown when we consult the Print
prefixed to Lauder's Musae same of 1739. There we find under the counten-
ance of an equally aged man, though with countenance turned in the reverse
way from the other: “ Aetat. 52, 1629 ”. This last is not reconcilable with the
statement that he was born'tn 1587, and would throw back his date of birth
1ο 1577, making him sixtyfopr 11 the time of bis death, an age, certainly, with
which the features of the print entirely correspond. There is error somewhere‚
but the latter inscription 11 probably the more correct. As yet there emerged
only suspicion of error, but in which of these conflicting entries was as yet
uncertain. The first real ground of doubt emerged incidentally in correspond-
ence with the Rev. Mr. Craven‚ of Kirkwall, who, inter alio, mentioned to me
that he was the possessor of an interesting Thesis‚ printed at Heidelberg, at
the delivery 11 which Arthur Johnston presiderl as Professor, and bearing the
date of 1601 ! This was startling, and wonder was expressed whether 1611

was not the real date, but 1611 was found obstinately imperturbable. The Ι

genuineness of the Thesis is beyond disputa, and 1111 possessor of it kindly
transmitted it (7th May, 1891) for my inspection. It bore the MS. inscrip-
tion, probably in Johnston's own hand-
