⁸: An a specimen os worthy John Barclay’s somewhat feeble versification with its
qusint old spelling, is appended his translation ol this epigram on New Aberdeen.

NEw-ABERDEEN enrich’d by Dus clear streame
All praise hom ancient Cities justly claims3

lt's blessed with Churchee famous in all lande,
And Temples lramed by no mortali hands.
Muses alse famous as once Rome did grace,

Have hallowed allow into this place.

Α Collega moy be seen not iar hom thence,
Where Learning fixed hath its residente.

The Mertai-place where men reeort ior gain,

ln stretched out into a spacious pltin;

There you the stately meme-Hom may view
Whoee Battlements are ol t stom-Herm

There Palaces os Peers you may espy,

Whose Lofty-Tops approach unto the Sky,

And Torvus-MensHosscs there you may behold
Which gnrnish’d are end shining like the Gold.
What need l further the three Hills to name
Which ae three Bulwarls fortifie the Same.

Like these on which that city doeth stand,
Which once as Hesd did all the Barth command
The Woot-mn-titt which all the rest outvyes

ln pleasantness, this City besutifiee:

There is the Well os Spa, that heolthsull Fons,
Whose Ir’ne-hero’d Wnter colloureth the Mouet.
Not far from thence a Garden's to be seen,
Which unto Jamtson did appertain:

Wherein a little pleasant House doth stand,
Painted (as 1 guess) with its Masters hand.

Dee doth afford of Salmon wondrous stote,

The Neighbour·Sea brings up into the shore.
The riches whereos Egypt makes her boant,

And initian-tremores come into this Coast.

Α Bridge doth reach along the River Dee,
Wherein seven double stately Arches be ;

Who built this sumptum-work is ye would know,
The M yur which is carv'd thereon doth show.
But let the Vulgar sort these things command,
The Citium to praise ldo intend.
