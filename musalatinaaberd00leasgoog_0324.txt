CLIII. TITYRUS FASTING, OR THE SELF-TORMENTING
CLERGYMAN.

Α soliloquy by a clergyman whose income, no doubt through the political events oi the
times, has fallen low, and he informs his floek compleiningly os the short commone to which
he has been reduced. lt is a wonderful grouping, br an ecclesiastica! purpose, into one
anthology, ol the varied imagery oi pastoral lile and occupatione.

ARGUMENT.

Ι have a quarrel with you, my sleek floclh end am compelled, though
with a sense of shame, to bring you into court. lt is wrong in law to
withdraw the reape1³s provender, wrong to muzzle the ox that treadeth out
the corn. Dire poverty oppresses me, and 1 am the laughing·stock os my
compeers, through my privatione of back and belly, while your wants in
both are well supplied. My ill-clad spouse and hungry children cry aloud:
“Tityrus, what are you about? Leave the flock and drop the shepherd's
crook. Try some other trade, that oi wielding the plough or awl or scissors
or the shuttle and such like, and be master oi your own hte. Be it your first
care to drive the wolf of famine from the door.'' Alasy ior my toils: it is the
duty of the flock to support the shepherd. How I habe laboured to lead you
to rich pastures, to refresh you by cooling streamr,3o preserve you from ill
iniection, to protect you from wolves, and all thishn all westhers, warring
with snow and showers and surly winde. The shepherd should receive a
tenth, but there hardly falls to me a hundredth pantol what is due, and so

my purse is always empty. And when 1 ask my rights, there is raised a
bleating protest, and some with petulant horn would butt at me. Has my
flock come under some weird spell, like Circe's, cha 'ng their nature and
degrading them? They look at me with eyes askan and l am forced to

he Lord oi shepherd
and of sheep will peradventure send in the future better times.

suffer hard things. Yet l must use no harsh words.
