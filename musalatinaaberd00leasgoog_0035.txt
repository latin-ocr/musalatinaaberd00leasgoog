THE CHRONOLOGY OF JOHstON,S LIFE.

Tris current Biography of Arthur Johnston, which has formed the basis of
the traditional accounts regarding him, is thatwtliich appeared in 1741, pre-
fixed to Benson's Edition os his Version of the Psalms. lt was composed
originally in English, and was translated intd Latin, of which an English
retranslation is found at the commencenint of the previous volume os
the Musa Latina Aberdonrnsis Priority as to time is due to another Bio-
graphy, which appeared in 1739, the Life, viz, which is found prefixed to
William Lauder's Poetarum Scotorum Museo Sacrae, a work which iesued
from Edinburgh, and bears the publishers’prames os Thomas and Walter
Ruddiman. i

On these two Biographies have been blaed the Lives that have subse-
quently become current, such as those in „Chembers' Lines os Ernr'nent Scots-
men, in Bruce's Eminrnt Men of Alcman, and in David lrving'e Lines os
Scolislr Writers, as well as the more recent one by Rev. Al. Gordon (oi
Manchester), in the Nalioual Biograplry. By far the weightiest and beet ia
the very careful Biography by a non-British author, the abbe Boulliot, in
his work called Biograplrir Ardrnnnisr, Paris, 1830, to which wc have fre·
quent occasion to allude. Even the most critical and painstaking of the
British Biographies, such as the two last named, labour under a grievous
inaccuracy which has been propagated froin the primary Biographies in a way
to vitiate the chronology of the earlier part of Johnston's career.

There are two chronological errors which require correction in these
Biographies. First‚ as to the date of Johnston’s birth, which was assumed
by Lauder and Benson as 1587, and has come to be repeated in all subse-
quent biographies. The evidence now adducible is conclusive that this date
is certainly wrong, and that the real date is nearer to 1577.¹

¹ 'l'he crux ie as severe ae in the case oi Columbae, whose birth date range· over an
uncertain period often years (Pteecott, reru, and labella, Chap. V.).
