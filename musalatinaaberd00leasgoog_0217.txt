Cur hodie nobis structa est in Apolline coena?
Quid sibi tanta volunt gaudia? Nata Dea est.
Nata Dea est, et nata Deis Pandora: dederunt ·
Frontem Iun0, Charis lumina, labra Venus.
Quae frons ista Deae? quae lumina? quae labra? Certat 5
Frons nivibus, caelo lumina, labra rosis.
Tilenus mentem dedit: hanc cum corpore confer,
Hoc homines dices, hanc genuisse Deos.

Α prime melon, Melville‚l presented to Tilen, the pnes-product ol my
garden. A similar gift should have fallen to you, but these apples ol honey
are not good for an old man. Cinnamon suits better an old man's stomach,
and pepper and Falernian from an ancient cael, or grapee from the Euganean
hills, or egge warin from their mother’s nests, hare, and partridge, and a tendet
kid, or the bird that hails from Phasis. These are the gifts for you; to one
as eold ae winter, melon would be as hemlock.
