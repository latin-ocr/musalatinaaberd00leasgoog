One might bave expected Inverury, as being nearer to Caskieben, to have
supplied instruction ; but although he has an encomium on that town also,
it is to Kintore he gives the credit of his early training. lt is singular
that we know more of his school than of his college training, and al-
though Aberdeen was no doubt the place of the latter, it is not very clear
which of its two colleges he attended.¹ The chief glimpse of his youthful
student years we obtain from his biographical epistle (No. XXIX. of Vol. 1.)
addressedtoDavidWedderburn,containingreminiscencesoftheiryouthfuldays,
from which we leam that he enjoyed to the full, in company with his young
friend, the sporta of mountain climbing and other youthful recreations, no
doubt including expeditioris for the sake of angling, of which, judging from
his piscatorial poems, Johnston must have been extremely fond.

After he has finished his Scottish education‚ he betakes himself, being a
younger son that had to look out for himself, to the continent, and we first
find him at the Casimir College of Heidelberg in the autumnos 1599. The
authority for this fact, recently discovered, and now for the first time included
in his biography, will, with all details, be found in the Appendix, and it is
really the first reliable date as to Arthur Johnston’s career. The brilliant
youth enrols first 111 student, but ere long, viz., in 1601, we find him presiding
as professor at a scholastic disputation in the same seminary, and the thesis
on the occasion still remains as evidence of his having sojourned at Heidel-
berg and occupied a chair there 11 his first position. (See Appendix No. 1.)
Although Heidelberg was his first habitat on the continent, it did not long
retain him, for we soon find evidence of his location at another city with which
he is more associated than with any other continental town,-Sedan. Still
Heidelberg must have interested him greatly, as some of his earliest poems
were printed at the Heidelberg presa, and we can now easily account for the
fervid interest he shows in the fortunes of the Ρ11111111112 and the city of the
Neckar under the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War in 1619. The attraction
that drew him from Heidelberg to Sedan was no doubt the invitation received
from Henri dela Tour, the sovereign princeos Sedan, and through marriage

with his first wife, bearerof the august title of Duc de Bouillon. Such invita· 7 ⁴

tion had been issued by this prince in pursuance of his favourite scheme of
fostering a universityat Sedan. (See Appendix No. 11.) The Duc de Bouil-
lon was closely connected with the Electoral family of the Palatinate, and

¹Lauder says it was the King’s College; Xennedy, Annon, 11, 112, claims him for
Marischal college, as does also Alexander Johnston in his Gmealogical Account os llic Family
of Jofintlon, 1832, followedby Sir C. F. Shand in Funerals, p. 18.
