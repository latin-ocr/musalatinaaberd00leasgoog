T olquh6n‚ when he had made hie house rich with offspring and lands,
worn out with age, quitted the world without a sigh. This tomb he formed,
caimly expecting his latest day. Near by are seen the fields² he devoted to

lord’s mansione, that have more than once entertained royaity. Such are
Toiquhdn’s memoriale, and amid these big creatione he saw hie reeour'ces
grow. How poor a thing ie man, ii you look to the body’s mortal coil; but,
if you weigh the endowmente of hie mind eo deep, how great he ie!
