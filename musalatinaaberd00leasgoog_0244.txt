CXXII. ICONES REGIAE.

1. REGIS.

Quid tibi cum Rege est, pictor vanissime? Fuco
Martia Grampigenae cur Iovis ora linis?

Pinge genas vulgi; minium servetur Iaccho,
Aptaque cerussae mater Amoris erit.

Principis ut tanti pictura sit aemula, pingi
Hune decet Andina Maeoniaque manu.

r. vanissime] Perhaps an allusion to Van-dyclr, the great court palnter oi Chulee 1.

2. rue Queen’s (ie, Henrietta Maria).

Married to Charles 1. in 1⁶25, fied hom England in 1644, and lived in her native Franee
to see the Restoration, and died in 1669.

In eanvas glows the image oi Maria blandly smiling on you. Behold
her brow, eyes, lips, bosom. The brow beams with majesty: her eyes rival
gems: her lips are like roses: her bosom is pure as snow. Juno, Venus,
Pallas are in Maria seen united, Juno the powerful, Pallas the chaste, Venus
the charming. The better to represent Maria, here royal Juno lays aside her
srowns‚ Pallas her Gorgon, Venus her love-spelis. Yet the image thou dost
gaze upon equals not the original, and the goddess ol the picture falls short
in lustre. Either pigments are too darlr, or, 0 Painter, the goddess’s eyes
have dimmed and dazzled yours.
