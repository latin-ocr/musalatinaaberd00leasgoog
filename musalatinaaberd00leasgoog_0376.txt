Forfar, thy pride is in the remains of a royal paiaoe, a lake, snd fertile
country round. With narrow burghal territory, thou att scknowledged queen

of Angus,and rurai glens remote own thy courts of low. While the bsilies
dispense justice, the folk is busy at its trades, preparing leather irorn skins of
fat bullocks, and cordovan to cover the feet of maidens. Sandals for Italians
and slippers for Franciscsns thou supplicet, and boots or brogues areprepared
by thee, a fence to country people against ice and snow. 'Twas with such
greaves the old Achaeans were armed, and the tragic buskin and the comic
sock was an invention of the same rustic folk. Let Rome and Sparta both
veil their pride. They put a yoke upon a people’s necks; Forfar shsckles feet
and legs obedient to her sway.
