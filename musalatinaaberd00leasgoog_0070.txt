Aseries upon the needle-embroidered tapestries oi the Lady lsabella Seton, Countess
ol Lauderdale. Alament over her in No. cxxxvul. [On tapestry as a characteristic
ornament oi the time, see No. XX., l. 24, and we may recall Shakspere’s description ol
lmogen's chamber (cymh, ll. 4· 68): ‘¹ lt was hang’d with tapestry ol silk and silver‚'' eto]

ARGUMENT.

With various gilts drawn from various elimes, behold the products in
tapestry of the Minerva of Lauderdale. The gold is from Tagus, solt silk
from China, purple hue is of Tyre—but compare the treasures‚ and the
Scottish needle surpasses all. ’

2. HER FLOWERS IN NEEDLEWORK.

ln early spring, when the beauteous Seton saw the first flowers on the
enamelled mead, she took her needle and traced on linen Flora's footsteps.
There you behold Iris and the Poppy and the tender Crocus, Violets in blue
. and purple and gold; white Lilies with yellow King-cups, and Tulips like
a sun or stars. The Rose is there, both red and ivorywhite-resembling, the
one, her snowy neck, the other her rosy lips; so also the columbine, the
Hyacinth‚ the Flos Adonis, and eke the Narcissus. Place flowers of Nature
and of the Setonian needle side by side: any eye will avouch that both are
real, or, if painted, painted by the same hand.

3. rnu1rs. ’

You behold here fruits in purple and gold, glorified by the fair Seton’s
hand. Grapes, olive-bernes are there, with apples, lemons and peaches;
cherries and pears and arnber prunes, all the wealth of the gardens oi
Alcinous. Zeuxis deceived the birds by his grapes; here are apples, vines,
olives that would deceive Pomona’s eye, or the eyes of Lyaeus and Minerva.
