CLVI. COMPLAINT ΟΕ THE RING SENT ME ΟΝ NEW
YEAR'S DAY BY GIQORGE GORDON, SON OF MARQUIS
OF HUNTLY. '

Α playful expostulation on the parthi the ring st transimence from the linger ol a
nobleman to that oi ahumble poet ξ

ln the annals os King’s college [Fusa pp. Q] the poet, then rector, and Huntly (the
second marquis), as chief oi a commissiori givisitction, had a personat meeting. As this isa
posthumous poem, it probably belongs to ΝΜ, 1637·8, and, il so, the George Gordon,
son of Marquis os Huntly, must be the Georgo Gordon who asterwsrds tell at Alford. lf
earlier than 1636, when the first msrquis died, lits addressed to the Georgo Gordon who
became second marquis, but in that case it is diffissltlto say how it was not embraced in

the Delitr‘ac ol 1⁶37· The same dubiety ol' rei ce occurs in the series oi poems
cxxxl1.,ete. p

nouum. : Ι

Alas, for my gleaming gold, my radiant sparlde, my orbed form suggestive
of the celestial sphere, my artistic design surpassing the material-the old
honour attaching to me is gone. 1 arn the possession of a poor person now,
though formerly of a lord. 1 have left a hero for a poor poet. Ill befal the
New Year's Day that consigned me to my fate. When the announcement
came, the gem changed colour and the gold turned pale like lead ; whereupon
1 said, ’Tis not for poets to blaze with gems: Homer sang for a copper‚ and
Virgil for bread. ΙΙ Ι was to be given away asa present, some courtly linger
of a princess should have been my fortune, to adom her neck or to receive her
kisses. Such were my vain imaginings. But the hero who gave me meant
me as a royal gift. Let me believe him worthy of the gift who stands as
client to such a patron.
