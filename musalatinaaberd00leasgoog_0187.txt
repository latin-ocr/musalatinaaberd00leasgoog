have more of honour than has Morton.

2. MORTONIUS THESAURARIUS.

Si virtus vel forma daret vel sanguis honoreS‚
Mortonio maior nullus in orbe foret.

Os their Pirean [Pierian] treasure‚ to give same

To painsul Curius or grave Cato's name.

Had thou, brave Judge‚ liv'd in euch golden boys,

Thy Head had long ere now been crown'd with BayS,

But Wisdom now is richly prized os none,

Nor Virtue Guardians finds till she be gone i

Six'hundred years ago, how happy 1,

That Day, when thy braye Antestor did dye

Hie Face¹ with Danick Blood: he did bequeath

Life to his Country at the Doors of Death ;

Yet this brave act was elos'd with one sair Day;

But thou didst still sor rnany Years display

The Ensigns os thy Vertite, and fierce Jnrs,

Intestine Broils worse than the worst os Wars,

Did quell Combustions‚ saie did keep horn Harrn

Chast Piety and raging Wrath disorm,'‘ etc.

A more complete version is found, with some variations, in Maidment’s Scottish Elegiae

Verres, where it is said to be taken from a MS. os Sir Robert Sibbald, “ Elogia, ete.,’' in
Advocates' Library.

¹Another reading is “My iace,’‘ in which case the river Tay is the speaker as rejoicing
in the victory at Lunearty, where the Hays were said to be ennobled. See No. LVIII.
