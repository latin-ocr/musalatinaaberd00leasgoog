LXVIII. ON ROBERT YOUNG (JUNIUS)‚ CUT OFF
ΒΥ DROPSY.

Perhaps one of the six sons of Sir Peter Young‚ joint preceptor (with Buchanan) oi
James Vl. (see Row's H. of ct.. p. 316, n.; Nichols’ Progr„ 111. 60; Lettm os Eminenr Men,
Camd. Soc., pp. 143, 172).

ARGUMENT.

In spring, with years still immature, Junius dies, a victim drowned by
dropsy. The fountains of Castalia he had almost drained: ’tis not strange,
if too much water overwhelms him.

LXVIII. DE ROBERTO IUNIO, HYDROPE EXSTINCTO.

Vere eadit, nondum deflorescentibus annis,
Iunius: immiti funere mersit hydrops.

Castalidum fontes prope qui siccaverat omnes,
Quid mirum nImiis si iugulatur aquis?

2. Iunius] Latin sor Young‚ as in Milton’s fourth Latin ekgy, Thomas Junius=
“Thomas Young ¹¹.
