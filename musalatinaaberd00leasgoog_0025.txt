1490 13 1113 0333 01 Arthur, fifth Lord Forbes; and in the skirmishes and feuds
of the Gordons and Forbeses we hear of Arthur Forbes, known as Black
Arthur‚ 3 303 01 Lord Forbes‚ as slain at Tillyangus 13 1571.ι (Misc,
Sp. ct, 11, p. 38, and cf. Sir R. Gordon’s Earldom of Sutherland.) Apart
altogether from the collateral affinities, the Johnston family possessed in
itself a foremost place2 among the baronage of scotland, and there is reason
to believe that a fairly good title could have been made out under old
Scottish law, for the Earldom of Mar falling to their line. (See note
in Vol. 1., p. 210.) Their seat was Caskieben, on or near the site of what is
now the modern 113111111311,3 31033 10 Inverury; and there the poet spent his
youthful years, as he himself informs us (Vol. 11., N o. LVII.), under the evening
shadow of big Benachie and near the streams of Gadis and Urie, which water
the valley of the Garioch to the north ο1 that mountain, and unite with the Don
near inverury. The region was one of stirring memories: the battlefield of
Inverury was close by, where Bruce won his first victory 3ηά commenced his
triumphant march to Bannockburn, 3ηά 301 131 off was the field of Harlaw
(the poet’s encomium on Inverury, No. 20, conjoins these two local battlefields)‚
31 the last of which, in 1411, the Celtic clans met a great defeat, preliminary to,
and premonitory of, the greater disaster of a later day at the battle of Culloden.
Little is known of his father George, except that he was a good Protestant,
and “ subscribed the Bande anent the religioun 31 Aberdeen in 1592'' (Cal-
derw., 5774). He was 3130 03 1113 Commission along with Earl Marischal
to seek and take the “three Popish Lords,'' but his death in 1593 prevented
him from taking part in the Glenlivet battle of 1594·

The school education of the young Arthur appears to have been in a
seminary at Kintore, where he 13113 us in his Encomin U rhium he learned his
Latin :—

“ Hic ego sum, rnemini, Musarum factus alumnus,
Et tiro didici verba Latina loqui ''.

¹It is supposed that the poet was named aster his uncle, the Hon. Arthur Forbes of
Towie, killed at Paris, 1574 (Sir R. Gordon's Earldom of Sutherland, p. 171),a nephew of
Black Arthur of the Tillyangus fray.

² In the valuation of 1549 (Collatinus, Sp. Cl.‚ p. 116), “ 1113 Lard of Johnstoune '' (along
with and abreast of Drum) is among the highest, apart from peers 01 the realrn.

⁸ By 1669 Caskieben ie in the hands 01 Keiths (Jaffray's Diary, p. 184), being then lost to
the Johnstons. Caskieben, 11111 now is, is in the parish of Dyce, about eight miles from
Aberdeen. lt was originally called Newplace, but the Johnstons in losing the primel
Caskieben transferred the name which still adheres. Even the second Caskieben passed into
other hands, among others, those of Alexander Henderson of Caskieben, the learned author
of the work on Aneient and Modern Wines; whence Lord Rutherford’s joke as 10 0331113113
being the Scotch uanslsrion of Horaee's 1111111013 nota Falerni.
