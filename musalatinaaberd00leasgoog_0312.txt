ERROL.

anabusns.

Glory ol the maiden band, Hay the Demoiselle is either sprung of seed
divine or by favour of the Gods has grown a Goddess. Golden her hair, gem-
like her eyes; her lips are ruddy with scarlet: snowy whiteness rules the rest.
Her breath is ambrosial, breathing nought but amomum, spikenard, violets
and roses of the Carse-land. Following her lead, the Siren may leam to quaver
melodiously in song and the Goddess [Diana] get lessons in leading up the
woodland dances. The lute in Euterpe’s hand grows mute, what time she
sways the sounding quill that sweeps the gilded lyre. As oft as she takes
tapestry in hand, Semiramis herself, nay, Pallas may resign to her the
needle. Should she wallr abroad, Leda will cease to please high Jove,
Leucothoe to please Apollo, or Venus Mars.

CL. DE MARGARETA ΗΑΥΑ COMITIS ERROLII FILIA.

Virginei decus Haya chori, vel nata Deorum
Semine, vel Divum munere facta Dea est.

Aurea caesaries, sunt gemmea lumina, cocco
Labra rubent, niveus cetera candor habet.

Os olet ambrosiam, nec spirat praeter amomum
Et nardum et violas Carsiacasque rosas.

Dum praeit haec, siren voces inflectere cantu,
Et nemorum discat ducere Diva choros.

Quam gerit Euterpe, mutescit barbitos, illa
Dum regit auratae plectra canora lyrae.

Texta manu quoties capit, ipsa Semiramis illi,
Ipsa suam possit cedere Pallas acum.

Prodeat haec, nec Leda Iovi est, nec candida Phoebo
Leucothoe, Marti nec placitura Venus.
