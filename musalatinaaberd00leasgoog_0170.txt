ΟΝ DE GULIELMO FORBESIO TOLCHONO.

Auxisset cum prole domum Tolchonus et arvis,
Confectus senio sponte reliquit humum.

Condidit hunc tumulum, quo conditur ipse, supremum
Exspectans animo nil metuente diem.

Hunc prope pauperibus devotos aspicis agros,
Tectaque mortali non violanda manu.

Nec procul his domini surgunt palatia, Regis
Non semel hospitio nobilitata sui.

Haec terris monumenta dedit TolchonuS, et inter
Has operum moles crescere vidit opeS.

Quantum, exuvias si spectas corpori8‚ alti
Si pensas animi munera, quantus homo est!
