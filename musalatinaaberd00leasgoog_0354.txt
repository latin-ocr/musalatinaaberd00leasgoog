CLXII. AD REVERENDUM VIRUM‚ IOANNEM
LESLAEUM, EPISCOPUM RAPHOTENSEM, DEDICATIO.

Laus sacri, Leslaee, chori, dum tendis iernen,
Et nova dextrorsum te Cynosura trahit,

Me sine ne properes; nostri cape pignus amoris;
Quem damus hic praesens est panacea liber.

Hac mens fracta malis, nullis cedentia succis
Hac persanantur vulnera cordis ope.

Vrurus Nos Onunr.
