B. THE SAME.

Of the high and mighty Prince, sprung from high and mighty ancestors,
what an embryo image the small tablet doth supply! Within this pertrait
you can at the same time gaze upon his latheds countenance‚ and one can
discern the lineaments ol both his grandsires. The right hand bears the olive,
the other hand the laurel: the lanrel points out the lord ol Arma, the olive that
ol the Gown. Be these thy distinctions, boy: the olive which thou bearest
comes from James, the laurel from Henri [Quatre]: each is a gift from thy sire.

Β. ΕιυευΕΜ.
Principis ingentis, proavis ingentibus orti,

Quale rudimentum parva tabella dedit!

Hac simul et patrios spectas in imagine vultus,
Et gemini quivis ora tuetur avi.

Dextera lert oleam, laurum manus altera, laurus
Armorum dominum monstrat, oliva togae.

His claresce puer; quarn fers Iacobus olivam,
Henricus laurum, donat utramque pater.

6. Oliva] Sec No. lx, on James 1., “the Pacific ”.

4. rus burra ou ronu's (i.e., the future James IL).

Here let us admire the young Duke's likeness: while you see in it looks
of martial strength, you see also looks that charm. ln one and the same
image there breathe at once threats and smiles3 both Mars and Venus gleam
out together in the delicate countenance. V ulcan beholding it bursts into his
wonted uage, and calls the heavens to witness his impeachment. The Powers‚
he swears, whom Cynthius caught in one couch, have now corne together in one
painted board.

Hic Ducis effigiem pueri miremur: in illa
Martia dum spectas ora, venusta vides.

Una minas spirat simulet blanditur imago,
Et Mars et tenero lucet in ore Venus.

Mulciber hanc spectans solitas exarsit in iras,
Et superos testes criminis esse iubet.

Quos olim in thalamo deprendit Cynthius uno,
In tabula iurat iam coiisse Deos.

13. Mulciber] Same allusion as occurs in No. LV1.‚1. 18.
