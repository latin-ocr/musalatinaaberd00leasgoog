CXXXII. TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS EARL GORDON, ELDEST
SON OF THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLY.

(From No. cxxxn, onward to No. CLI. inclusive, the poems follow the order ss they
appear in the posthumous Middelburg edition of 1642. They are miscellaneous poema, not
appearing in either the Delitiae or the Parerga or Epigrammata as publisbed in Johnston's
lifetime.) The group of poema under CXXXII. appears to be in honour oi tbe accomplished
George, second Marquis of Huntly‚ who succeeded to the marquisate in 1636. His letters to
Strsloch appear in Misc. (Sp. Ch), l., 11⁴6, and see plura regarding him above in Vol. 1.. p. 302,
n. 7; slso note in Spalding Trabes, 1., p. 32· Allucion is made in Nos. 5 snd 9 of this series to
his poetic gifts, no doubt in Latin verse, and cf. 11·8. The most interesting relic ofhis muse is
the Latin distich which bad the honour of being inscribed on the palace of the Louvre in Paris,
quotcdinCollectiomlsp.Cl.),p.38. Aquestionmay‚however,arise,whetherthe“EarlGordon”
oi the serles Is not the brave son of the second Marquis, also a George‚ the same who altenvards
fell at Alford 1645, and No. 3 can be claimed as evidence, for he was wounded in the ware in
Alssoe st Speyer. If the poema are later than 1636 (and their non-appearance ln Johnston's
lifetime points in this direction), and if they are of the same period as Nos. cxx111.-v.,
which undoubtedly concern the sistere of the Lord Gordon who fell at Aliord, we must assign
them as in honour, not of the second Marquis,¹ but of his brave son who fought and fell under
Montrose at Aliord, but who is not known otherwise to have cultivated verse.

On the Huntly family see notes on No. XLIX, also No. CXIV. 6. Α tolerable English
poem on ‘⁸ Georgo, Earle of Amic, etc.,” occurs in Gardyne's Gordiu.

ARGUMENT.

Lately thou wert leading armies, scion of the House of Huntly, and war·
like Gaul felt the pith of thy might. After vanquishing the foe, thou wearest
Venus' chains, and the Cyprian queen draws thee as a thrall. The example of
Kings keeps thee in countenance: bravest Hector and great Achilles were each
a soldier under Cupid. Shouldst thou, mayhap,0 scion of the Gods, refuse
to follow mortale, there are immortals in the sky for you to follow. Mars,

laying down his casque, kissed the Queen of Beauty, and the Site, throwing
the thunder-bolt away, breathed the confession “ 1 love ''.

¹'I'he second Marquis had married Anna cambella (see No. CXXXVII.) as iar back
as 1607, and No. 1 of the series must accordingly be confessed to suit better his gallant son
Lord Georgo, whose death is described by bis noble kinsman (Records os Aboyne, pp. 537-8).
