The tomb ol a noble Forbes you now behold: bear now as to his
character and mind. T he toil of others to obtain wealth was, while he
lived, to him a pastime. When called on to depart this lise, he said with a
smile: “Farewell, earth3 my possession is now in heaven”. His wealth,
his acres let not any one admire: it was better to be lord ol himself apart

from lande.

CV. ΙΝ OBITUM GULIELMI FORBESII CRAGIVARRII.

Nobilis hic tumulum Forbesi conspicis; audi
Qui suerint mores, ingeniumque viri.

Quod labor est aliis, vitae dum carperet auras,
Divitias illi quaerere ludus erat.

Cumque iuberetur terris excedere, ridens,
“Terra vale, caelo nunc potiemur‚'’ ait.

Quas possedit opes et terrae iugera, nemo
Miretur ; dominum plus suit esse sui.
