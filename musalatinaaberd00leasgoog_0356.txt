mond‚ and in English) prefixed to the book entitlcd “Varieties,. . . by David Person ol

Abig world is here contained in little bounds, and Jove marvels at the
work of human art. In a irai] sphere of glass, Greece once bound up the
world; now a small perper-chart holds it with great Jove. The orb of glast is

CLXIV. IN PRAECLARA DAVIDIS PERSONI
GYMNASMATA.

Finibus hic arctis ingens constringitur orbiS,
Et stupet humanae Iuppiter artis opus.
Hunc olim fragili conclusit Graecia vitro,
Nunc brevis immenso cum lovecharta capit.
Vitrcus interiit, durabit charteus, orbis,
Ingenii donec cultor et artis en't.
