man was already umor of Arts in 1599. I think that proves that he was
born before 1587, if this Arthur is identical with the Latinist of the'
seventeenth century.” (See Appendix No. 111.)

Here there was irresistible evidence that the birth date of 1587 for a
Professor of Philosophy presiding at a disputation in ¹599 must be a mistake,
but further it war a discovery to leam that Johnston had studied and taught
at Heidelberg befote betaking himself to Sedan.

The most important Biography of Johnston, as already indicated, that of
the abbe Boulliot, meires no mention of the Heidelberg period, but brings
him to Sedan as early as November, 1603. The Abbe is evidently perplexed
even by this date for a youth bom in 1587, for he says apologetically :-

“ 11 fit ses etudes dans sa patrie. A seize ans ses talents etaient de·
veloppes comme s‘il eut atteint l'dge mbr. . . . He continues thereafter:
Attire a Sedan . . . il y'arrive dans les premiers jours de November, 1603,
accompagn& de Gualtier Donatqson, son compatriote. Le 22 de ce mois il
fut nomme Regent de la troisienie classe du college academique. L’Univer-
site, frappee de ses heureuses dispositions et de ses talents prematures, le tit
passere la seconde classe le ια juillet, 1604, et le nomma en meme temps
professeur de logique etde metaphysique. Il exerpa durant six ans ces
emplois.” ‘

From the above evidence φ to his Heidelberg studies in 1599, it is clear
that the birth date of 1587 can'not be maintained. The probability is that it
was reached hyan estimate formed from the inscription on the (Middelburg
Edition) vignette‚ where 1639 appears instead of what turns out to be the more
correct figure, 1629, which, as we have said, is found on the Portrait in the
Lauder Edition of 1739· How Lauder came to give the birth date as 1587,
with ‘¹ aetat. 52, 1629,’' in the Frontispiece of bia own book is hard to under·
stand, and 1 leave the crux for others to unrsvelrl
