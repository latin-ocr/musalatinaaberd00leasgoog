Akuuusrrr.

Your ancestors, J0hnston, will ever be extolied by Scotiand's sons.
To them were entrusted the borders betwixt two realms, reward of valour
and stainless honour. How great the hero whom Wallace chose as com-
rade, who won abroad and at home a thousand trophiesi England trusts'
to dead walls piled up to keep out the Scottish soe: Scotia needs only the
Johnstons as a living rampart to make her saie.

LXXV. AD IACOBUM IONSTONUM, BARONEM DE
IONSTON.

Maiores, lonstone, tuos, dum Martia vivent
Nomina, Fergusidum gens super astra ieret.

Credita sunt illis gemini confinia regni,
Hoc meruit virtus, et sine labe fides.

Quantus hic est? socium quern legit Vallius unum,
Inter mille duces fulmineasque manus.

Quantus erat, qualisque pater! qui fortibus armis
Mille foris peperit, mille tropaea domi.

Anglia Grampigenas exstructis molibus hostes
Arcuit, et muro iunxit utrumque fretum.

Hostibus opposuit Ionstonos Scotia vallum
Invictum, quo nil firmius orbis habet.

w H 5. vassius] For sake oi mette, presumably, instead oi the more usual “vallas‘’ =
aare.

9. Angue] This credits Englaud with the erection os the “Roman waii'' betwixt
Newcastle and Carlisie; and there is further treedom used in the mention oi utrmque

fretum, which is more suitable to the northern line oi defence‚ between Firthr of Clyde
and Perrh, than to that between Tyne and Sonay.
