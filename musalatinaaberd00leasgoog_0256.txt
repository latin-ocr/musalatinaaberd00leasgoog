charles, while in eagerness for the chase you tend northward in buming

real, you turn your royal back to the south. At once Orion, cloudconrpelling,
frowns in the sky, and Auster pours unseasonable floods. Doenr· not these

rains to be sprung from spongy clouds: regard them as the sky's own toan,
weeping because you run away.

2. DE EADEM.

Caroie, venandi studio dum tendis in Arcton
Fervidus, obvertens regia terga N0t0;

Contrahit in caelo frontem nimbosus Orion,
Intempestivas fundit et Auster aquas.

Has tu ne pluvias bibulis e nubibus ortas,
Sed lacrimas caeli, quod fugis, esse puta.

The King put off the journey he had projectcd to the northern regions,
when, Ο floods, ye fell stom the sky. At once he broke off his march, when
he saw the clouds come gathering under host and snows shed hom a frosty
sky. To the Powers on high he yielded obedience: do you, Ο Britain, take a
lesson to observe the nod of your higher Power.

3. ns EADEM.

Rex iter, Arctoas quod erat molitus in oras,
’ Distulit, e caelo cum cecidistis aquae.
Mox iter abrupit, cogi cum frigore nubes,
Et gelido fundi vidit ab axe nives.
Praebuit obsequium Superis; hinc discito nutus

Observare tui, terra Britanna, lovis.
