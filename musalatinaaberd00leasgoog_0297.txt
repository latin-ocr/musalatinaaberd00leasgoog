2. ΟΝ THE saltu Lanu.

On her embroideriea see No. Llll. Α.

Another Penelope lies here, another Pallas, aa potent with the shuttle as
with the Babylonian needle. We have seen wild beasts by her art embroidered
in gold, and birds on fine linen clad in varied plumage. We have seen, in
silver, fishes depieted underneath the deep, and N ymphs such as bear sway in
the glassy waves. Upon the ailkworms’ spoils a Goddess’s cunning hand
inwove flowers, and apples rivalling the furit-casas of Tyre. The same dett
hand made kings and captains to step into view in tapestry hangings, and with
bold art lashioned lordly men as Goda. ln short, whatever prophetie poeta
have portrayed in song, her needle has bidden live for aye. Ye weird sistere,

ἔξω rule the spindles and life’s thread, this lady surely should have been saie
m you.

2. DE EADEM.

Altera Penelope iacet hic, iacet altera Pallas,
Tam radio pollens quam Babylonis acu.
Illius arte feras intexi vidimus auro,
Et volucres bysso multicolore tegi.
Vidimus argento pictos sub gurgite pisces,
Et Nymphas vitreis quae dominantur aquis.
Bombycum spoliis Divae sollertia flores
Texuit, et Tyriis aemula poma cadis.
Intulit aulaeis eadem regesque ducesque,
Audaci dominos finxit et arte Deos.
Denique fatidici quidquid cecinere Poetae,
Illius aeternum vivere iussit acus.
Quae regitis fusos et vitae fila sororeS,
Haec saltem vobis non violanda fuit.
