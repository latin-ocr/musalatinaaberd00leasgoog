Saltibus in patriis, bellum sine fine cruentum
Trux leo cum saevo monnocerote gerit.

Hic stant concordes posita feritate, Britanni
Et simul hic scuti fulcit et alter onus

Quos decet esse viris illo sub Principe mores,
Qui docet immanes ponere bella feras?

'ibe Aegis Pallas wears as arms: in triple brass she shows Medusa’s
loclrs respiring with dark snakes The boss which you, Charles, display, unlolds
silver Lilies, golden Lyre, and wild Beasts coming thundering on. 'ibe triple
brasc must yield to the silves and gold: the Gorgon’s snaky monster is no
match lor the wild Beasts’ lightning stroke

Aegida fert Pallas ; spirantes anguibus atris

Phorcidis haec triplici monstrat in aere comas.
Carole, quern gestas, argentea lilia, plectra
Aurea, fulmineas explicat umbo feras.
Aegidis aes triplex argento cedit et auro,
Cedit fulmineis Gorgonis hydra feris.

Fierce the Lion was alway deemed; the Leopard was thought dire3 the
Lilies fragrant, and Phoebus' Lyre tingling with song. Here the Lion lays
aside his fierceness; the Leopard drops his savageness and rage; the Lilies
yield no scent, the Lyre no sound. To be like the King, the Lion grows tame,
and the Leopard's disposition you see grows more mild. So when the Quecn
unlolds her bosom and opens her lips, the Lilies shrinlr lrom shedding odours
and the Lyre is dumb.
