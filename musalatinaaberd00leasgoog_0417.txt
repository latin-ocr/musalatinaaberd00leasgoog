dation os the Editorial Committee, to assign the two volumes of
the Orneuns aun Gnanvnres and Boncn's Livns (together 609
÷ xxxvii. pp.) to the year 189 3 ; and to regard the Ruconns 01²
Andrus, ol almost exactly equal bulk, as constituting the issue
sor 1894. On two former occasions, in 1888 and in 1889, the

has been the usage os the New Spalding Club to consider the
representatives os a member dying in any year, alter having paid

that year, even though such representative should not elect to
join the Club. But, according to Rule 9, “ Every member not
in arrear with his annual subscription shall, srom the date os his
becoming a member, receive one copy os every volume printed

appearing in 1894, might be claimed at once by the representa-
