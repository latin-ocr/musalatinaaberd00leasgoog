CLIV. a. APOLOGY OF THE LADY'S PUPPY.

ARGUMENT.

Why attach, you prating parrot, our matchlessjady and her dogs so

petulantly? Why lay down the law to your mistress, and refuse to tolerate
those whom she chooses to prefer to your kith and kin? You brag os your
colours in green and vermilion. We too have our varied colours to compare
with yours, and we can lilrewise show striped and spotted whelps, variegatod
like the speclrled marble through nature's prodigality os power. As for dignity
and merits‚ you are no favourite oi any god, while we are patronised by Mars,
and iorm Diana's bodyguard. No parrot ever reached the skies: the dogstar
twice over figures in the heavens. Our duty is to guard our master's chambers,
to lie at a lady's snowwhite feet, to watch while you, O parrot, are lapped in
’ sleep, and no price or prayer can bend our faithfulness. 'Tis not our way to
barli, though our Umbrian cousin or the Molossian may ; we only give a low
munnuring growl when any young intruder ventures near. We bite for fun
and are seen to sheda tear, and we come tumbling, rumbling over one another
to catch the hem oi our mistress’ robe orto play with her playful hand. The
hounds of Sparta and the big mastiffs may give wounds: we refrain. Your
bealr and claws, on the other hand, are truculent, and sometimes girls have to
dread your malice. Again, you are a captive, and, but for your cage, would
cease to serve your mistress, who yet feeds you with all dainties‚ cinnamon
and other products of your native soil. Why grudge her ladyship an extra
pet? The gods and goddesses have double favourites; such as Venus in her
doves and swans; Minerva in her owl and cock, and so with various other
gods. A double pet is no sign oi fickleness; so away with pride, be patient,
and submit to bear an equal.
