6. ΟΝ THE DWELLING 01² THE SAME WHBN summu ΒΥ Λ ΤΕΙΡΕὸΤ.

Possibly the storm oi 1⁶33, of which Spalding speaks ss throwing down the ‘¹ stately
crowu” of King’s college.

0 Dwelling of Gordon, hospitable‚ yet not worthy of him as an inmate‚
and not to be dwelt in by any of the Peers hereafter‚ lately we saw you bend
under the sweep of ruffian East winds, and huge bloclrs built in Pergus' day
[i.c., of date immemorial] were shaking. Yet you fell not; you, for all that,
were not o’erthrown. ’Τ was your inmate that caused this boon, l'or he
resembled a Tutelary God. Either the Spirits of the Storm dreaded a people’s
lamentations, or the prayers that 1 poured forth have prevailed.

6. DE EIUSDEM HOSPITIO TEMPESTATE CONCUSSO.

Hospita Gordono, non hoc tamen hospite digna
Et procerum nulli post habitanda domus.

Te modo nimbiferis impelli vidimus Euris,
Structaque Fergusi tempore saxa quati.

Non tamen eversa es, fuit hospes muneris auctor,
Et tutelaris Numinis instar erat.

Aut tempestates populi metuere querelas,
Aut ego quas fudi praevaluere preces.

7. ΟΝ THE IMAGE OF HIS LADY, SUSPENDED FROM HIS NECK.

ls the Earl ol Enzie who became second marquis is the subject oi these poenis, it is
interesting ro note that in what is received aa the portrait of the second marquis at Aboyne
essue, such a medallion or miniature is seen suspended from his neck.

No garter gold-besprent and gorgeous with the Red Sea's spoils, surrounds
thy leg. Neither dost thou wear a star on shoulder‚ such as outshines Phoebus*
light what time he moves Day onward‚ seated in his gilded car. On thy breast
thou bearest this Lady, painted by Apelles. A golden casket encloses it, a
work of Myro. When, Gomon, thou fingerest this, thou feelest pangs‚ and
every time thou gazest thou hasta pulseofamorousflame. What praise lives
in letters of the ieet or stars of the sky? 'tis better to bear upon the throne
of oue's breast a celestial Goddess.
