REFERENCES TO ENCOMIA ΟΝ ARTHUR JOHNSTON.

See Preface to Delphin Edition of Arluri Ionstoni Psalmi Dauidici
London, 1741, where appear Ten citatione in prose and Latin verse,
frorn various authors in praise of Johnston. ndu those in Latin verse
by Dr. Geo. Sibbald of Ranlreillour, by Rev. Andrew Ramsay, and
Professor John Ker (pp. xlix, li., and lxiii. of Lauder's Musae Sacrae,
1739). From his friend, David Wedderbum, we have the tribute in
Del, ll., p. 554: “Hinc lonstonus opem confert, quo se hospite
Olympus Nunc iactat, quondam Pindus,'' as also his Epistola (Det,
11, p. 573), ending with “Phoebus Unus semper eras, tu mihi
semper eris ''. In Ruddiman’s Vindication (p. 229) the verdict ofa
Dutch scholar, Gutherleth of Lewarden (Leovardia). Bishop Lowth
(Sacred Poetry os the Hebrews) refers to Johnston's version of Psalm
XLII, and Dr. Beattie compares the merita of Johnston and Buchanan
(Dissertations, Moral arrd Critical, 4²⁰ edition, p. 645). The only ones
have room to cite in full are three: one from the present century, from
the pen of the Aberdonian Historian of Scotland, whose somewhat
aeid deliverance regarding him must however be taken with some
modifying salt, the remarkable one from a critic of Johnston’s own

century, the learned Dane‚ Olaus Borrichius, and the eulogium from
his contemporary and countryman, Regent and Professor in King's
College‚ Α Strachan, in his Panegyricus Inauguralis. We take
them in their historical order.
