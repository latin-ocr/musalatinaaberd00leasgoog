CXLVI. TO Α LADY, FROM THE ENGLISH.

This extravaganza, by way os compliment to a lady, is rich with the lancy os the
Elizabethan time. The original source has not been discovered.

ARGUMENT.

Ask not regarding the gleaming atoms‚ whensoever the sun unsolds his rosy
ray, whither they prepare to drift along. 'Tis on thee the boon os heaven and
of the upper powers bestows the sparkling dust, and Venus herself entwines
it in thy locks. Ask not whither Philome} wends her way, what time the hoar
srost falls, and the ancestral grove stands lealless. She nestles in thy throat's

liquid recess to winter there, and thence she pours her vernal ode. Ast not
whither Flora calls away the roses, what time the sun urges his prone steeds
southward away from the northern clime. These plant themselves at thy
leet: athousand rose-gardens thou suppliest to ¹the world, a thousand seeds
of flowers thou cherishest. Ast< not in what pool the stars, which one sees
glide along in the quiet night, sink their ruddy flames. Into thine eyes thou
conjurest them3 in these orbs they linger, just like stars fixed in their rolling
spheres above N either ask as to the Phoenix, whether it is in the East or
West that that bird places its incense-breathing nest. That bird, when worn
out with nerveless age, hies to thee and dissolves in ambrosial odours on thy
breast.
