sesamum.

7. mass.

Poems by waterdrinkers, Ennius says, do not long bear the light But
on whomsoever Bacchus smiles, lu possessas fiery force; the offspring he of
ethereal Jove If you like the feasts of frogs, go write your strains in company
with frogs below amid the waters.

7. massus.

Quae scribuntur aquae potoribus, Ennius ipse
Lucem ferre diu carmina posse negat.

Lumine quem placido Bacchus videt, igneus illi
Est vigor, aetherei et digna propago lovis.

Si te ranarum capiunt convivia, deinceps
Carmina curn ranis scribe in aqua, et sub aquis.

8. Jorrusrou.

The poetry of Pindar who dranls water still livea in the world’s eye and
bns no death till the world likewise dies As ior your bibulous friend Ennius
and his poema, they have perished with their author. No wonder: the bever·
ago that carried off the bard, how could it sustain his poenis in life?

8. rousrosus

Cernis adhuc pota quae scripsit Pindarus unda,
N ec metuunt, mundo non pereunte, mori.

Quae tuus hic vino madidus dedit Ennius orbi
Carmina, cum domino disperiere suo.

Nec miror: laticem, vatem qui sustulit ipsum,
Carminibus vitam quis dare posse putet?

9. riuus.

Bacchus loves the knolls, the knolls are the Muses’ most pleasant seat,
Cynthius himself affecta the knolls. Hence (under favour of my mystic Logic)
come wines, what we call Aonian waters. If you agree with me, let us clasp
right hands, but be each hand charged with a goblet of pure wine lf you

prefer water before grapea the cups of Achelous before Bacchus, your head
and hand alike are dazed.
