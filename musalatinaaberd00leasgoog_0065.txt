Robert Wilkinson, No. 58 Comhill, faces the biographical sketch ol Arthur
Johnston in the Iconograplria Scotica, by John Smith of the lnner Temple,
London [1798] ; but by what appears to have been a careless mistake‚ the
name inscribed beneath the picture is “John Johnstone, M.D.''. Another en·
graving from the same picture, published r Dec. 1798, by Edward Harding,
98 Pall Mall, is in Pinkerton's Scotisli Gallery, London: 1799. Acopy of
this engraving is in the portrait serap book belonging to the Royal College of
Physicians of Edinburgh.

The Marischal College painting, aphotogravure of which appears in this
volume, is mentioned at page 123 of Bulloch's Georgo Jamesone. It is
inscribed ‘⁴ 1621, Actor 4² ”. A copy of this painting (not the King’s eollege
one, as erroneously stated by Mr. Bulloch) done in oil, by Wales, for the Earl
of Buchan, is in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. Another
copy, painted in 1837 lor the late Mr. Alexander Johnston, W.S., by John
Henry of Edinbnrgh, isin the possession of the writer.

55. The engraved portraits ofJohnston, contained in his Poemata Omnia
and in two editions of the Poetarum Scotorum Musa Sacra, are mentioned
under Nos. 15,21and23. These cannot be said to bear much resemblance
to either of the paintings now extant. The frontispiece of the Poemata Omnia
is shewn in one of the glass cases in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.

56. There are two engravings ol Johndon taken by John Michel Rysbracln
from a bust which belonged to Mr. Auditor Benson. One, engraved by G.
Vertue in 1740, which is in the quarto edition of Johnston’s Psalms, published
in 1741, is mentioned at No. 26, and the other, by VanderGucht, 1740, which
is in the octavo edition of 1741, is referred to at No. 27. A copy of the
formeris in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, and another is in the por·
trait serap book of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. There is
a woodcnt taken from it in Anderson's Scottish Notion, 1868, Vol. ΙΙ., p. 577.

57. One ol the lights of the window, known as the Melvin Window, at
the east end of the Library of the University of Aberdeen, represents Arthur
Johnston, the likeness having been taken from the King's College portrait. ·
An illustration and description of this window is given in James Melvin, a
sketch by David Massorr. Aberdeen 1895. See also p. 528, Fasti Academica
Mariscallanoe aberdonensis. New Spalding Club. Aberdeen 1889. The
first named book was edited, and the latter written, by Mt. P. J. Anderson,

Secretary of the Club, and Librarian to the University of Aberdeen, to whom
l am much indebted lor valnable assistance in the preparation of this
bibliography.
