CXVI. TO MR. RICHARD MAITLAND. Ι

Νο one os this name known in the Lauderdale family unless as a servitor oi the family.
See entry (anno 1629- 30) in Misc. (Sp. Cb), V. p. 147. 'l'he probability is that it is a Richard

Maitland ol Pittrichie in Udny, Aberdeenshire‚ of whom some account is given in collection

(Sp. Cb), p. 358; also in Funerals, p. 4373 Nisbet’s Hcroldry‚ 1. 293· Α Richard Maitland‚
minister at Aberchirder‚ is dealt with in 1640 by the Covenanting party (Spalding. Tralles,
l. pp. 311-2). Compare t'or the vein of thought No. Llll. above.

ARGUMENT.

Golden gifts thou mayst have from others, Maitland‚ as thy moed, or
purple vestments with Tyrian dyc. Ι can oller only words with no worth,
accents oi no weight and “ numbers ” whereol the banker makes no account.
Accept, asan old friend from another, a trifle in poor return lor thy guerdon.
Thy present, I remember‚ was both ol corn aud wine: Ι bring thee only
waters from Pierian spring. Exchanging pawkily my poor brass for thy gold,
Ι fulhl the rdle of Diomed‚ thou ol the lavish Glaucus.
