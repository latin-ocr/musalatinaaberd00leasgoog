2. nuhwnto.

Lo two quills: one portrays in light bright touches, with motion like
yours, 0 Eurus, airily sailing along. This came from great Jove’s snowy
wing, when in swan ahape he sought Leda’s kisses. The other was dropped
by Jove's pinion, when he became the bird of thunder, enamoured oi the

Phrygian boy. Eaeh recalls its nurturing bird. With dashing touches yon
feather will portray your doings, with deit light touches, this.

2. affirmes.

Ecce duos calamos; nitida hio elementa figurat,
Hic par remigio est, mobilis Eure, tuo.
Ille olim niveis magni Iovis excidit alis,
Cum peteret Ledae basia, iactus olor.
luppiter hunc caelo demisit, fulminis ales
Cum fieret, pueri captus amore Phrygis.
Quisque suam volucrem referens, illustribus ille,
Exprimet hic promptis, Rex, tua gesta notis

3. uruomsrro.

Beneath this roos l sway the sceptro of the tongues, and teaeh my country·
men to utter languages other than their own. The Spaniam, the Teuton may
here listen to his native accents, and the Frenchman along with thy imperial
people, 0 martial Rome. Silvery clear in speech the Spaniard is, foroeful the
Teuton, while gracefulness belongs to him who drinks the Loire, maJesty to
him who drinks of Tiber’s stream.¹ ln expression they differ, but the burden
is the same: ‘⁸ Live, 0 Charles, the Father of thy Country”.

3. LINGUARUM Mhulsrhh.

Hoc ego sub tecto linguarum plectra guberno,
Et doceo cives non sua verba loqui.

Hic lber, hic patrias audit Germania voces,
Celtaque cum populo, Martia Roma, tuo.

Est Iber argutus, vehemens est Teut0, venustus
Cui Liger, altiloquus, eui rigat ora Tibris.

Accentu differre vides, vox omnibus una
Haec tamen est: Patriae, Carole, vive parens.
