Laedere Gordonum lapsu qui nequiter audes,
Quid tibi non optem, saeve caballe, mali?

Exue cum freno phaleras et ephippia, tergum
Nemo paret strigili comere, nemo iubam.

Indue clitellas posthac et iunctus asello
Verte molam, plaustrum vel trahe, more bovis.

Non potes armenti generosi pullus haberi,
Bellua, tardigradi gloria prima gregis,

Non iuga te Scythiae, non te tulit Africa tellus,
Nec quae nobilibus'claruit, Astur, equis.

Ditis equi, Nycteus, Aethon, Orphnaeus, Alastor,

’ Ad vada Tartarei te genuere lacus.

Pegasus excusso domino conscendit Olympum,

Ad stabulum Stygii te decet ire lovis.

On Janus’ sacred mom, whoever claims offerings from Johnston, ploughs
the strand with unavailing heilers. The Deity we poets worship is rich in
silver and gold, grander and more splendid than even Jove. His sheen is
golden; his house of gold sparkles with gems, the like ol which the wave ol
the Eastem Sea never knows. He turns and winds his golden-maned coursers
in his ruddy car, and, himself all golden, directs his gilded wheels. Gold too
is what is champed by his steeds, as is witnessed by the flames that consumed
thee, 0 Phaethon. 'Tis on ambrosia and pure nectar that this breed subsists
-lood such as regales the whole celestial band, not excepting Jove. Alack for
me, the votaries of Phoebus have lurid looks: they are kept down by sore
famine and by poverty. Farewell, Phoebus; score out ol thy records an old
dependent: Ι am loath to pay vows to an ungrateful God. lucense hereafter
l'll bring and fall down at Gordon’s shrine; lte shall be, under great Jove, my
protecting Power. I am not afraid that he will behave like my former master
and sin after thy example. One ground there is of sear, he too cultivates the
Muses; and the same infirmity that keeps his brethren down, perhaps affects
himaswell,
