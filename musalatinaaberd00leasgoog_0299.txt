2. ott THE snlffl LADY.

When sleep had stolen over her, the frameworlr oi her coueh, through
some strange hap not long ago, gave way, and Eliza tumbled out. Close tc
her chamber stood Paris, the arbiter ol beauty, and grouped around him were
Venus, Juno, and Minerva. The Shepherd with the epple in his hand, the
moment he saw Elias undrcssed‚ exclaimed: “ She, she alone deserves beauty's
prrze”.

2. DE EADEM.

Somnus ut obrepsit lecti compage soluta,
Nescio quo fato, nuper Eliza ruit.

Adstabat thalamo formae Paris arbiter, illi
cingebant Cypris, Iuno, Minerva latus.

Poma serens pastor, nudam cum vidit Elizam,
Haec formae pretium sola meretur, ait.

3. ou rna snus saur.

The jointed lramework of her eouch gave way, and all os a heap the
Nymph ol Tillyiour¹ fell, smothered almost in feathers. Her maid-servants
saw the misehief, but not one was seen to moum or tear their bloodless cbeeke.
The sole creatures that mourned their mistress were the pups she had reared,
and pitiful was their whining mixed with tears. Hence leam, ye mortals,
what poor fidelity is in girls, what leal fidelity dwells iu whelps.

3. ms annau.

Cardine luxato thalami, Tilifuria Nympha
Corruit, et plumis pene sepulta fuit.
Spectavere nefas famulae, sed plangere nullam
Vidimus, exsangues vel laniare genas.
Quos aluit soli dominam luxere catelli,
Et iunctum lacrimis flebile murmur erat:
Discite mortales, quam sit male firma puellis,
Et quam sit catulis intemerata fides.
