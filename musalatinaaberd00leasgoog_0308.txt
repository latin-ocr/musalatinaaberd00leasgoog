CXLVII. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SPOUSE OF ENDYMION PORTER, OF
THE ROYAL BED-CHAMBER, ΟΝ ΤΗΕ· FIRST OF
JANUARY, FROM THE ENGLISH.

Endymion Portet accompanied Prince Charles and Buckingham in their expedition to
Madrid, 1623 (Nichols’ Progn, 4·877‚ 94o); was mixed up in the fortunee os King Charles 1. ;
see also three interesting letters by Portet in Niclrolas Papm (Camd. Soc), v01. 1. The vein
ol thought is kindred with that ot* CXLVII.

ARGUMENT.

Go hunt the Armenian wild beast, and send its precious skin as a present
to Endymion's Goddess. Such be the presents to the Goddess‚ although she
herself is soster and whiter than any Armenian wild beast. Climb mountain
peaks, and if in those rocks there is any star, whose rays a diamond concen-
trates in a short blaze, you will lay it at the feet os the Goddess‚ who sur·
passes with her eyes all the light that Jove's high lightning bolt can yield. Dive
in the eastern waves, and there let the pearl be sought‚ which you see formed by
the dew ol heaven. Let, 1 say, the pearl be sought though it dazzles the eyes
of Kings‚ and let it surpass all the wealth that the sea conceals. Yield this
also to the Goddess‚ although to her a tear is more precious than gems, such
as the shell produces What royal mandates do Ι here enjoin? With what
languid service do my attendants wait on me for my behests? The Goth does
not hunt for me, neither does the brown-coloured Indian climb rocks nor the
sluggish race of Aethiopians enter the waters. Though thus emulous of Kings
whom their own sels-confidenoe deceives‚ ’tis in credit rather than in real
assets that our Muse gives boone.
