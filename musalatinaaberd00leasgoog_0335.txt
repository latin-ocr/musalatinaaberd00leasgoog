CLIV. 3. GRIMALKIN TO LADY ANNE GORDON.

ARGUUBNT.

Enough hasbeen heard from that prating pair; it is meet to heara few
fit words from me. My claim is not because¹ 1 flatter a mistress, nor tense
and plague my fellows, nor do 1 boant a sleek, gayeoloured skin; but hearken
to what heaven has bestowed as my peculiar boon. Masculine courage and
fiery ardour are ours: we cata areamartial troop. Besidesafiercecountenanoe,
nature has given us eyes of flame that ree in the dark, and alone os quadrupede
we find our way in the gloom of night. A whiskered face, a tongue that
ecrapes like a file, still clews, now strained to scratch, and anon drawn in
within velvet paws, compoee our ἕψῃ». When roused, 1 am taken for a
lion or the lion’s cousin, and my 'ight is outehing prey. Not the mouse
arone, but featheoer rowr 1 suit after. Anu ω, rary, when you wrm a
’ harmless and not dangeroua hunt, you need not climb dangerous Grumpian
heights, following, like an Amazon, shaggy hounds; you can enjoy a hunt
at home, watching how 1 lie in wait for my prey at the ehinks aud crannies
and then pounce on the trembling rover. After a little play, the victim is
presented stretched before your feet So in bird-hunting; don't take the
falcon to that work, but leave me to the duty, lor, though I have no wiugs,

1 capture the winged prey. 1f such sports please your ladyship, give me a
place among your favourite pets.

CLIV. 3. AELURUS AD ANNAM GORDONIAM.

Sat canis, Anna, tuas, sat psittacus imbuit aures,
Ambo simul stulta garrulitate pares.

Si vacat, aelurum nec dedignaris alumnum,
Fas mihi sit de me pauca sed apta loqui.

Non ego te palpo, socios nec vellico; feli
Artibus his famam quaerere turpe puto,

Nec proavum titulos, superum nec iacto favorem
Plus satis est domina te, Dea, posse frui.

3. helmum] The Greek αἴλουρος, as well as Latin ‘⁸ felie,’' do duty in thir poem.
