Il you count the seasons, the steed ‘¹ Balagaunius ” surpasses in age all
the horses that crop the Scottish meads. 1 would almost believe him to have
seen the light either in Marius' consulship or when Troy fell by Grecian guile.
His ioot is stili, and leanness is over all his hamc, and from his stubborn
mouth he rejects the accustomed jagged bit. But when Gordon mounts him,
he makes him outfly the lightning-bolis and the wing-footed breezes of the
South. When the heroic Gordon wakes in oldjohnston the Muses of song, what
wonder if he likewise shows himself in veteran steeds their lord and master?

· 12. DE BALAGAUNIO EIUSDEM EQUO.

Tempora si numeres, senio Balagaunius omnes,

Pascua qui tondent Scotica, vincit equos.
Hunc ego crediderim Mario vel consule natum,
Pergama vel Graio cum periere dolo.
Pes piger est illi, macies in corpore toto,
Et solitos duro respuit ore lupos.
Hunc tamen ut scandit Gordonus, fulminis ignes
Cogit et alipedes antevolare Notos,
In sene Ionstono Musas cum suscitet Heros,
Quid mirum est vetulis si dominetur equis? 10

1. satagamus] Some high-enunding name lor a ‘¹ Bucephalus” or ‘⁶ copenhagen.’'
perhaps originally from Balagowm a messuage on the Aboyne estates.

3. Mario] Marius being ream times consul, the date seems simply chonen to imply
antiquity.
