4. DE EIUSDEM REDITU IN URBEM.

Ver violas, aestas segetes autumnus Iacchi
Munera fert solus, horrida bruma nives.

Tempore cur igitur brumae novus incipit annus?
Frigora quid, luces quid meruere breves?

Haec dum, Iane biceps, anni primordia Phoebi
Quaeris in acclivi tramite, mente cares.

Cessit honos hiemi, Gordoni maxime rerum,
Abredonum populis te quia reddit hiems.

5. ΟΝ THE LAMENT OF THE SAME ΟΝ THE DEATH OF BUCKIE.

Achieftain oi one oi the branches oi the house ol Gordon. See No. CXL. Afighting
race, one oi whom fell against tho Forbesea at Tilliangu's in ¹571 (Mire. Sp. Cl., 11.. p. 38);
another ol them wae prominent in the affair oi Donnibrissel; but this particular Buckie, bere
celebrated, is uncertain. lt probably refers to a younger Euclrie who died in 1630, and would
be ol like age with George, Lord Gordon. Α raesimile signature ol a Gordon oi Buckie
appears in Mire. Sp. Cl.. 1.. p. 4⁰·

Buckie succumbed to death-a warrior who while sadly foreboding his
country’s disasters, preferred to die before. The sad end of a devoted retainer
was moumed by Huntly's son; with Aonian waters he bedewed hia bier.
Through Homer's song Achilles lives after death, and Aeneas' fame survivea
through Virgil's aid. Buckie excels them both, whose luclr has been to be
celebrated in a great poet's strain and by a great chieftain's praise.

5. DE EIUSDEM ELEGIA IN OBITUM EUCKII.

Buckius occubuit, patriae qui lunera maestus
Dum praesagiret, maluit ante mori.

Funera devoti proles Huntlaea clientis
Flevit, et Aoniis busta rigavit aquis.

Carmine Maeonio post mortem vivit Achilles,
Vivit et Aeneae lama Maronis ope.

Buckius hos superat, cui magni carmine vatis,
Contigit et magni principis ore cani.
