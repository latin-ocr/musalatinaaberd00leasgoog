according to the common accounts, when on a visit to Oxlord‚ where he had
a daughter married to a clergyman of the English Church, he fell ill and died.
The Suspiriu of his friend David Wedderburn (printed in Aberdeen in the
same year, 1641) bewail his death, and the Middelburg edition of his collected
works by William Spang, in 1642,l may be said to be the funeral monument
immediately subsequent to his decease.

Into the great controversy as to the relative merits of Johnston and
Buchanan which extended into last century, when the Baron of Bradwardine
is represented as taking Johnston's Latin Psalmo by way ol Sunday reading,
we cannot at present enter. Any discussion of the question will come
more appropriately in connection with the Peumata Sacra of Johnston, if we
should be fortunate enough to include them in some future volume. Nor
need we enter on the subject os Auditor Benson,² who conceived a strong
admiration lorJohnston, and lor his pains brought on himself the animad-
versions of Ruddiman and the acrimony of Pope‚ who gave him and his
protc'gb Johnston a place in the pillory of the Dunciad (IV.‚ l. 110). We
refer the reader who wishes to pursue the subject to lrving’s Scotislt
Writers (Vol. ΙΙ., 33-9).

The above is all of solid fact that the most diligent search has afforded
relating to the biography ol rlrthur Johnston, He stands out conspicuous
in the illustrious roll of learned Scottish Physicians, Fracastorii under a
northern sky, numbering Pitcairn in the eighteenth century, and Dr. Francis
Adams ol Banchory in the nineteenth-a trio os classical scholars possessed
of the “Phoebeae artes Geminae,'' to ose Andrew Melville's phrase in the
Delitirre (ΙΙ., p. 123), such as it is doubtful if any other single European
country can parallel. His greatest merit is to have composed a version os
the Psalms capable of standing comparison with that of his countryman
Buchanan,³ and the two stand forth as Dioscuri in that field, having as twin
stars added unique lustre to their native land. Both of them lived at a
period when Latin was the vehicle of cosmopolitan men of letters, and before

to raise himself to same by erecting monuments, striking coins, setting up heads . . . of Milton;
and alterwards by as great a passion lor Arthur Johnston, a Scotch physician's version of the
Psalmo, ol which he [Benson] printed many line editions ''.

³Tbere is a curious parallel in origin between the houses of Buchanan and Johnston,
and a resulting coincidence ol relation in which they severally stood to the Earldoms, in
the one case os Lennox, in the other of Mar. See P. H. Brown's Life of Bucherius, p. 6.
