LXXIV. TO JAMESONE THE PAINTER, REGARDING ANNA
CAMPBELL, THE HIGH-SPIRITED LADY.

Jamesone is mentioned by Johneton also in his ‘¹ Encomium '¹ to the city ol Aberdeen
in his Encomia Urbium. On George lemme, the ‘¹ Scottish Vandyke,’' as Horace Walpole
styled him, much has been written. Resides Mr. Bullooh'e excellent book, George Jametom.
consult Bruce’s Eminent Men os Abcrdaeem also Collatinus, spata. ctat (p. 57). ⁸⁸ Heroina '⁹ in
given to same lady in No. CXXXVII. Compate the nearly contemporary addrene to thdyck‚
by Edmund Waller, in kindred vein.

Attoultlztlt.

Bring forth all the colours of your art to paint the Lady Campbell:
brow ol ivory, breast oi snow, neck like privet-biom, tiny lips ol roses,
cheeks ol marble mixed with coral or the ruddy hue os apples, auburn locks,
eyes glancing like geme or like the stars; eyebrow like Venus' bow or
Dian's‚ when 'tis lightly curved. But, painter, suspend your hand; there
is something more subtle than any line can render, even stom Apelles’
hand. Paint the eyebrow with no pride, the eyes full ol modesty‚ the

sprightly being withouta flaw, and, to succeed, you have only to paint her
like herself.
