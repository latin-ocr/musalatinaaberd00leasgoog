CXXVII. ΟΝ THE ROYAL FLEET.

nouarum.

The isle that spurned the yoke of old Rome—an isle than which Thetis
hae in her bosom not any larger, remote from the whole world,—of old was girt
about with happy waters, and the calm expanse of the sea her servitor. Charles
now surrounds her with a wall of brass, and the sea receives her lord's armed
barke. Our isle is sale: here Mars, there Neptune, arbiter of the main, pro-
tects her; the one the brother, the other the son of Jove. Both are Gods, and
when each ministers to the King, the isle is shielded by the higher Power.

CXXVII. DE CLASSE REGIA.

Insula quae dominos est dedignata Quirites,
Et qua maiorem non capit ampla Thetis;
Orbe procul toto, quondam felicibus undis,
Aequoris et famuli marmore cincta fuit.
Carolus hanc muro nunc circumscribit adno,
Et domini armatas accipit unda rates.
Insula secura est: Mars hinc, maris inde tuetur
Arbiter: hic frater, filius ille Iovis.
Ambo Dii, sed cum Regi famuletur uterque,
Insula maioris numine tuta Dei est. 10

CXXVIII. KNIGHTLY INSIGNIA OF ST. GEORGE.

ARGUMENT.

1.

Whoever views the insignia of the Northern King, must deem nothing
grander to exist beneath high Jove. The furies ol Mars he is sure to contemn,
for the Knight [St. George] protecte his breast with steel, and the Dragon by
blame. The Gods minister to him,-who dare deny it? for Cupid adorns his
limbs with spoils and reliques os a Goddess. Who but would count him
worthy os world-empire, who bears on his shoulderscarl the stars of heaven?
