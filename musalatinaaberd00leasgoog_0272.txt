CXXXI. TO CHARLES Ι.

TO THE MOST SERENE AND MIGHTY CHARLES, KING OF scoTLArtD,
ENGLAND, FRANCE, AND IRELAND.

THE DEDICATION OF HIS PARAPHRASE OF THE stillo OT SOLOHON.

ARGUMENT.

Charles, flower of Kings, most august in thyself alone, most sacred beyond
all that the vast world can show, accept what gift I bring from Pierian hille,
the work of a King, who was also a bard divine. The Holy Trinity gave the
poetic numbers, the King who was David's offspring transcribed with pen, and
Hymen, filled with a divine spirit, gave the matter of the song. Here the Deity
Himsell chants from heaven His loving lays: in unison from earth, daughter,
sponse, and daughter-in-law respond. Subtract ⁴what here is ours, pluck out
any transplanter’s briars: the residue is all violets, lilies, myrrh, and roses.

CXXXI. AD SERENISSIMUM ET POTENTISSIMUM CARO-
LUM‚ SCOTIAE, ANGLIAE‚ GALLIAE, ET HIBERNIAE
REGEM, CUM PARAPHRASIN CANTICI SALOMONIS
DEDICARET.

Carole, fios Regum, quo nil augustius uno,
Sanctius immensus quo nihil orbis habet.

Quod fero Pieriis e collibus, accipe Regis,
Accipe divini nobile Vatis opus,

Sacra Trias numeros, calamum Rex praebuit, ortus
Davide‚ materiem Numine plenus Hymen.

Hic Deus ipse suos e caelo cantat amores,
Succinit in terris filia, nupta, nurus.

Tolle quod hic nostrum est, interpretis erue sentes,
Cetera sunt violae, lilia, myrrha, rosae.
