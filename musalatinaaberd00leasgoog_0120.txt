ΟΝ WILLIAM DRUMMOND.

LXXVI. ΟΝ WILLIAM DRUMMOND.

The friend os Ben Jonson and celebrated poet ol Hawthornden, to whom John Leech
or Leochaeus also devotes his Epigram XXXIX. in his praise. Scotstarvet wau no doubt
the link between Johnston and Drummond, A lull account of his lile-work ie given in
Professor Masson's admirable volume, Williom Drummond of Huwtlwmdm. The point of
the epigram consists in a clever tum, whereby‚ in comparison with the gredt Buchanam
Drummond is made the gainer by getting the first place in the then narrow contemporary
suffrage ol his country Scotland; while Buchanan comes out the loser by getting only
second rank in wide competition with all the Latin poeta ol old aa wellas newer time.

ARGUMENT.

By the Latin Muse Buchanan sought fame, rejecting with fastidious
ear the accents of his native speech. Drummond, though he might have
rivalled him in Latin verse, preferred as a vehicle his native tongue. Which
wius the palm? Scotia assigna the latter the first rank, while the elder poet
stands but adoubtful second among all the Latin bardo.

LXXVI. DE GULIELMO DRUMMUNDO.

Quaesivit Latio Buchananus carmine laudem,
Et patrios dura respuit aure modos.

Cum posset Latiis Buchananum vincere Musis
Drummundus, patrio maluit ore loqui.

Maior uter? Primas huic defert Scotia, vates
Vix inter Latios ille secundus erat.
