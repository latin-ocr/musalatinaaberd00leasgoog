11. TO THE SAME, ΟΝ Α FIRST 01² JANUARY.

(See No. 9 above.)

If a hero may recline at a plain, humble board, 1 ask you to be my guest
the coming morn. Three Gods received hospitality from Hireus in his log-
sustained tenement, and a poor shepherd was Alcides’ host. Nectar and
Ambrosia are reserved for the table of the Gods3 Helicon, the idol oi my wor-

ship, yields me nothing but its water. Disdain not the bowls oi the Castalian
band: the Castalian stream was always to thy liking.

11. AD EUNDEM cab. IAN.

Si licet Heroi mensis accumbere vulgi,
Te mihi convivam luce sequente peto.
Dis tribus hospitium trabe fultum praebuit Hireus,
Hospes et Alcidae pastor egenus erat.
Nectar et ambrosiam sibi servat mensa Deorum,
Quem colo, nil Helicon dat mihi praeter aquas.
Pocula Castaliae ne dedignere cohortis,
Grata tibi semper Castalis unda fuit. 8

3. Hireus] Perhaps Abraham in his tent More probably sor Hyrieus, whose story
is given in Ovid, Fasti, V., 499,

4. Pastor egenus] Molorchus seems to be meant, in tbe story oi the First Labour
of Hercules.
