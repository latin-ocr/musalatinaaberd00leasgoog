LXXIII. ΟΝ BISHOP ‘⁴ EUDOXUS'S'' FIELD.

Altonum.

Instead of oats sown by you beside the waters, there springs up only
mustard in the glebe. No Circe opereted here with spells, nor-she that
made old men young—Medea with incantatione. Health and Jove and
mother earth were prospecting lor your old age. Oete, the sood of poor
oxen, might hurt a ehiyering old man; but mustum, as Pythagoras can
witnesS, may send a flood of lire along your frozen veins.

2. ΟΝ THE snME.

Mustard‚ the product ol Egyptian soil, Pliny and Galen both extol.
Commend me to the mustard that met my eye in a prelate's glebe in the far
North. The N ilotic product operates only at close quarters and stirs tears;
afar off, the northern plant drew tears from the prelate's eyes when he saw
it growing.

3. ou tna stne.

The bishop's field is here: one part rampant with hot mustard3 one
part feeds fat oxen. Slay the oxen, pretate: spontaneous condiment is
near; and let us have “ bees and mustard''.
