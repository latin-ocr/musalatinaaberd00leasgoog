Faosrrsaracs. Poararrr or Aarrrurt Jorrnsron‚ after Jamesone, the ori-
ginal being in the Picture Gallery of Marischal College, Aberdeen. The
eost of this reproduction has been borne by Surgeon-Colonel Johnston of
Newton Dee, to whom the thanks of the elub and ol' the Editor are due.

The following extract from Bulloch's Jamesonc refers to this picture :—

The poet is represented as a youthiul man ol perhaps thirty, and bas the same
spirituelle expression as the pertrait in King's college. He holds in his lest hand a
rose, which surmounts his shoulder. His dress is ol a brocaded stuli. The picture is
on panel‚ and is a very fine and but slightly-touched specimen ol Jamesone’s work.

’.Ἧι John llay, who has had charge of rearranging recently the pictores in
Marischal College, reporta that he has lound the date on the picture ‘⁴ 1621, AEtat 42 ”.
This points to 1579 as about the period ol the poet's birth, and is a valuable confirma·

tion ol the evidence elsewhere adduced making the ordinary birth-date ol 1587 impossible.

N.B.—lt is proper to add that in Vol. 1.‚ p. xiii.. the words ‘⁴ AEtatis 3⁶3¹ stated to be
on the King's College picture corresponding, are an erroneous addition appearing in
and inherited from Mr. Bullocb’s otherwise excellent work on Janaesom. No such
words are found in the picture when examined‚ and the photogravure ltsell at the
commencement ol Vol. 1. exhibite no such entry. 'l'his clears away a most erroneous
statement from the evidence as to the year ol the poet's birth.
