CXXXIX. ΟΝ ELIZABETH GORDON, LADY OF WARDES.

The history ol this lady, who had a dubious reputation, is lound in Davidson's (lodoci,
pp. tao-r. She was a daughter ol John Gordon ol Newton, and was wife of Sir John Leslie,
the first baronet, ol Wardes, now spelt Wardhouse. Alter a chequered career she died os
cancer at Durhanr in 1⁶42. See Spalding Trublcs, 11. 217. ; Gordon's Scots Affnirs, ll. ¹³4·

ARGUMENT.

The Shepherd ol lda stood surveying Lady Gordon's bower, and there too
were the three Goddesses‚ whom love for the apple did consume too fiercely.
The shepherd was distinguished by his croolr, Juve’s spouse by her gorgeous
bird, Pallas by her shield, Venus by her flame. ln the midst stood Lady
Gordon, fairest creature in the world, and the fine linen garment clothing her
was as white as snow. Glaucing at her, Paris, as is moonstruck, grew dumb
in amaze; soon recovering himself he let fall these words: “When I took
Juno as stately, Minerva as sagacious, Venus as beautiful, l was, in my
vision, blind ”. “

CXXXIX. DE ELIZABETHA GORDONIA WARDESIAE
DOMINA.

Gordonae thalamum pastor circumstetit ldae,
Tresque Deae, pomi quas nimis ussit amor.

Pastor erat baculo, coniunx lovis alite picto
Insignis, clipeo Pallas et igne Venus.

ln medio Gordona fuit pulcherrima rerum,
Quaque tegebatur sindonis aequa nivi.

Hanc Paris adspectans stupuit ceu sidere tactus;
Mox ad se rediens talia dicta dedit:

“Cum mihi luno gravis, prudens Tritonia visa est,
Et formosa Venus, lumine caecus eram ’'.

1. Circumstetit.] Probably in some piece ol tapestry.
6. sindonis] As a nominative, seems a coinage oi Johnston's.
