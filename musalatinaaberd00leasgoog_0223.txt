Si, Ionstone‚ tibi lymphaticus esse videtur,
Qui lymphas Bacchi dulcis amore lugit3
Tu, fugiens Bacchum, accedes bacchantibus, haec dant

Grammaticae et Logicae iura tibi atque iuga. 4

Your mind has become dazed through your songs, and mine, Tilen‚ rages
in Bacchanalian fashion. Such strains Phoebus did not inspire, nor the group
that sips the Pierian waters. Eithcr screechowls dictated these stralus, or

my ollerings were apples of Mandragora

12. lONSTONUS.

Carminibus tua lacta tuis lymphatica mens est,
Et mea, bacchantum more, Tilene, furit.

Non haec Thymbraeus dictavit carmina vates,
Nec quae Pierias turba propinat aquas.

Aut striges ista tibi dictarunt, aut ego nostra
Munera mandragorae poma fuisse puto.

Your melon, Johnston‚ disdains my Iacchus, but a true melon is glad to
associate with itsell Bacchus and his beverage. lf it has nothing to do with
Bacchus, it stands the same to Venus. One would say it was a lit prize for
Boeotian pigs. ll it has nothing to do with Bacchus, neither has it with Ceres,
nor with thee,0 Venus, who art cold without both os these powers divine.
Uupleasing melon, get you away from this banquct, from this couch, lar away:
1 do not like your quality. To the pigs begonc; away from me, and get about
your business, Ο melon, henceforth to have no melody from me
