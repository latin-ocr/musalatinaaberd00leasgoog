1. MUSIC.

ARGUMENT-

Phoebus gave me a voice surpassing the nightingale, even Philomel,
amid her poplar sprays. Amphion's strains are mine, to tame tigers and move
stones. ''l’is the painters fault that you see here entrusted to the undying
canvas,0 king, my lips mute and my lyre. Now, animated by your eyes,
the image will breathe‚ and mouth and lyre will render their wouted strsin.

Os mihi concessit Phoebus, cui cedit addon,
Inter populeas et philomela comas.

Plectra dedit, rapidas quae possint sistere tigres,
Aut Amphioniis saxa movere modis.

Crimine pictoris tabulae commissa perenni
Muta mihi, Rex, hic ora lyramque vides.

Nune oculis animata tuis spirabit imago,
Et solitum reddent ora chelysque melos.
