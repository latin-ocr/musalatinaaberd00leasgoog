Aurum Jouusrou, Royal Physician or Medicus Regius to James l.l and
Charles l., the most distinguished writer of Latin verse (next to Buchanan)
that Scotland has produced, was through both parents of distinguished ances-
try. He is traditionally said to have been the fifth son of George Johnston ol
that illr² and Caskieben, aud through his mother, who was a Christian Forbes,
he was connected with the honourable and titled family of Forbes. The
year of his birth is involved in some difficulty, being placed by tradition in
1587, but ae to this there are grave doubts ; see Appendix No. 1.

His father, George Johnston, who was the seventh³ l'rorn Stephen⁴ the
Clerk, the iounder of thelohnston house in Aberdeenshire, succeeded his grand·
satherin 1548(hie own fatherhaving perished at Pinkie in 1547)and died in 1593.
He married Christian Forbes, a daughter ofWilliam, the seventh Lord Forbes,
who had married Elizabeth Keith of lnverugie. The mother of Arthur John·
stou lived to 1622, and she was said to have given her husband six sons and
seven daughters, ol' whom Arthur and his scholarly brother William were the
youngest sons. (Sir R. Douglas, Baronage ol' Scotland.) The grandfather
of Arthur who died at Pinkie had married a Hay, daughter ol the house of
Errol, and it is remarkable that the Hays have, as a family, a specially large
number ol poems by Johnston dedicated to their honour. How the old British
name Arthur got into the Johnston family we may explain through the con·
nection with the house ol Forbes, where that name appeared as far back as
