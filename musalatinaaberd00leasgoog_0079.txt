ARGUMENT-

Ii you admira Rome and ita people as the world’s novereign lady and
the world’a delight, bring into the arena of compariaon lovely Aberdeen.
Thetis waahes it with obedient wavea, just as the Imperial City adjoina its
handmaid aea. Both look down from heights on subject streams, and breathe
martial threna, each from her thundering citadel. The former boaata of her
Fabii, her Scipion, her Caeaats. The other recalls with pride her Menzieses‚

her Cullena, her Colliaons and her Lawaons. The Grampian city ia smaller
than that of Romulus, but her burgenses are men, in heart and head, aa good
aa of ancient Rome.
