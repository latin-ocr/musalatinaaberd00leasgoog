whose magnificent castle was the early residence of the princess, whom he
hailed as a compatriot and in whose destiny were· centered the hopes of
Protestantism.

The next important date in Johnston's life is 1622, by which disastrous
year (it was the year of 'Tilly's capture of Heidelberg) we find him returned
to his native country and enrolled as a burgess of Aberdeen (5th August,
Burgh Records, Sp. Club, p. 377). The Abbe Boulliot‚ in the quotation given
above, believes that he had remaiued on the continent till 1623, but this is a
mistake, as the evidence in the Appendix shows. His sojourn abroad, therefore,
came to an end before the close of 1622; and the curtain falls on his career at
Sedan, hisjeux d’espril with Tilenus, his quarrel with the “ grand seigneur ” in
the Ardennes, who threatened to lock him up in his dungeon, and his appeal
against him in the Court at Malines During his continental sojourn he
contracted his first marriage with a Belgian or Brabant lady, a native of
Malines, Marie de Cagniol,1 whose name is supposed to be the same as Marie
Kynuncle,² the spouse who accompanied him to Aberdeen and died there in
April, 1624. By her he seems to have had no less than thirteen ³ children, ss
we leam from his epistle to Wedderburn, but only six survived :-

“Numina iam decies et ter fecere parentem:
Pignora sex superant, cetera turba fuit.
Bis mihi quaesivi nec sb una gente maritam, etc’'

-(v01.1.‚p. 193·)

After his first wife's decease he is stated to have married Barbara
Gordon, whose parentage is said to be unknown (surg-Col. W. Johnston's
Genealogicol Accounl of the descendants os James Young, 1894, p. 194).
In Dr. Temple’s Thanage os Fermurlyu, p. 263, she is claimed as of the
Gordons of Newton. She was the mother of his son William who was bom
and baptised in 1636, and became in King's College a Regent Professor in 1657,
and afterwards Civilist in 1669. Barbara johnston survived her husband and
lived till 1650, when she was interced in Aberdeen (Accounts of Master of
Kirk Worlts in Burgli Accorwits, 1650). ln 1652 Margaret Johnston, a

¹Through the kind researches of the courteous Mons. Brincourt of Sedan the Brench
name of his first spouse has now been discovered (see Appendix No. 11.), and the dates of the
baptism at Sedan of some of their children.

'Kynuncle as found in the Burglr Accounts os Abcrdecn, appears to be the honest
attempt of the Master of Kirk Works of the day to represent the name of Marie de Cagniol in
Aberdeenshire spelling.

⁸ At the time of his suit with the “ seigneur,'' he speaks of six pignora as then depending
on him, in order to excite commiseration (No. xm, 1. 103). '
