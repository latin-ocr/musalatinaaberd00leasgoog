his high function nobly. Fourteen olympiade he lived, for Fate dated not

2. ΙΝ nuum.

Inspice natalem Forbesi, tempora vitae
Collige, supremam mente revolve diem.
Editus Augusto est; Patriis quod gessit in oris,
Praesul, id augusti muneris omen erat.
Vixit olympiadas bis septem: condere tantum
Ante diem Lachesis non fuit ausa iubar.
Occidit hoc ipso quo Clxistus tempore: miles,
Christe, tuus voluit te moriente mori. 8

Forbes is dead, the peerless bishop of our Aberdonian clime. Former
prelates built stone bridges to cross streame: he made for his people an easy

< pathway to the stars. The structores they reared to God, to the Muses and

to the poor, his hands upheld. As was the brightness ol his light, so was
felt the darkness following his extinguished ray.

Occidit Abredonae praesul Forbesius orae,
Par cui Pontificum de grege nemo fuit.
Marmoreis illi straverunt pontibus undaS,
Hic populo facilem lecit ad astra viam.
Quas illi Superis, Musis et egentibus, aedes
Struxerunt, huius sustinuere manus.
Quam formosa fuit tanti lux sideris auctor,
Quae iubar hoc mersit, tam fuit atra dies. 8

5. Aedes] Such as the King’s College Chapcl, the College Buildings, and Bishop
Dunbar’s Hospital.
