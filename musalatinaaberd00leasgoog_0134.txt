LXXXV. TO HENRI DE LA TOUR‚ DUC DE BOUILLON,
WHEN HE WAS LAMENTlNG A DAUGHTER’S DEATH.

The magnificent title ol this prince brings up the memories oi Godirey of Bouillon,
which is a castle oi Bas-Lunaine, in the province oi Luxemburg, in the vicinity oi Sedan.
Through marriage in 159¹ with the heiress oi the La Marcis family (onuentin uunvsrd
tame), he became sovereign prince oi Sedan. Being a leading Huguenot, brother-in·
law to Maurice the Stadtholder and to the Elector palatine, Fredericlr IV., and therefore
uncle-in-law to the ill-started Elector Fredericlr V, he gives protection and a position
to the exiled Scottish ecclesiastic, Andrew Melville¹ (see Lxxxur). A glimpse oi this
dulce is obtained in his letter to the synod ol the Huguenots at Tonneins in 1614, dated at
Sedan, and mentioning the quarrel oi Du Moulin and Tilenus (Quicls's Synodicon, 1. pp. 447-8).
Born in 1555, he died in 1623, having felt the first wave ol the incorporating policy ol France.
ln July, 1615, “a Jesuite is executed at Sedan lor intending to kill the Duke oi Bouillon with
aknyie’'; in 1617 he was with other princes proclaimed “traitor”. See contemporary
glimpses of him in Cecil's Lctters to Carere (Camd. Soc.) and in Sully’s Menroirs. The great
Turenne was the second son oi this Henri, duc de Bouillon, by his later spouse (see p. 17),
Elizabeth oi Nassau, daughter ol William, the great Prince oi Orange. The Duchesse de
Bouillon was thus aunt ιο the unfortunate Fredericlr V., Elector Palatine. Turenue was born
at Sedan, 11th September, 1611, and educated under Tilenus, Johnston's friend, as his tutor.
On Tilenus, see No. CXVII, A. 1.-ln the lltteenth century, Alexander, Dulce oi Albany,
brother os James 111„ who wanted ιο become Alexander lV. by submission ιο Edward 1v.
ol England, married Anne de la Tour, daughter oi the Count oi Auvergne and Boulogne
(sic). (Burton's Scot Abroad, 1. p. 69.) Accordingly his son John, Dulce oi Albany, Regent
oi Scotland from 1516 to 1524, was by his mother’s side oi the same La Tour family. See
notes on Nos. VII. and LV.

¹ “The Duke ol Bulloigne sent a letter to Mr. Andr. Melvill, dated at Parise, the 3oth οἰ
Januare, wherein he certified him that he had sent unto his Majestie, ιο obteane his libertie
out oi the Towre, that he might corne to Sedane '’ (calderwood, H. osli.. Vll. 153: plura in
Michel's Ecossais, ΙΙ. 16o7). On the long and close connection between Bouillon and the
Elector Palatine, see Green's Liues of the Priscesres, V. r8or. ln the next generation, in
1641, came, through Richelieu, the final collapse os the Bouillon family, and the complete
absorption oi Sedan into the territory oi France. As a town, Sedan now recalls Carlyle’s de·
scription ot' a typical German town: ¹⁸ Town consisting, as is common there, ot various narruvr,
winding streets, comparable ιο spiders' legs3 and oi aroomy, central master-place, compar-
able ιο the body oi the spider ” (Fried, 111. 493).
