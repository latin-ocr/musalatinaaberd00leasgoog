CXX. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF JOANNA JOHNSTON.

Who this joanna was ie unknown. The little poem is a gem even among Johnston's.
On Wedderbum see No. XXIX. os Vol. 1.

1. Jorrusrou,

assumunt.

Sudden death harh linked the tomb to the bridal conch, the funereal torch
to the marriage flambeau. A maiden she was when winter begam a spouse
when at its height, and soon, when it had passed away, she was only ashes
cold. Fortune's wheel is fickle, pleasure is ever fleeting, man's hope is alway
slippery and his life a span.

CXX. IN OBITUM 10HANNAE IONSTONAE.

1. IONSTONUS.

Ionstonae thalamo tumulum, taedisque maritis
Funereas iunxit mors properata faces.

Virgo fuit, cum coepit hiems, cum constitit, uxor,
Mox gelidus, bruma deficiente, cinis.

Est rota Fortunae volucris, fugitiva voluptas
Spes hominum semper lubrica, vita brevis.

2. WEDDERBURN.

Thalia gives Johnston the gift of undying song. Where then is there
room sordeam and funereal torches?

2. WEDDERBURNUS.

Ionstono carmen dedit immortale Thalia,
Quis morti hic facibus funereisque locus?
