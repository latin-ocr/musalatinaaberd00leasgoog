the present volume are much more varied than those os the
preceding, and although rarely so sustained in continuity, will be
found to offer much os pertinent interest to local antiquaries and
historians concerning the important period to which the Poet
belonged. ln particular, the groups ol epigrams on the Scot-
tish nobility and episcopate ol the time, and the encomiums
upon the various Scottish towns may be referred to as alone
justilying this re-issue ol the Poems ol Arthur Johnston.

The Editor cannot conclude without acknowledging his
special obligations, among other friends, to Mons Brincourt os
Sedan‚ to the Rev. Mr. Craven os Kirkwall lor important
assistance in his investigations; and to Surg.-Col. J0hnston
ol Newton Dee, who has lurnished Appendix V. (the Biblio-
graphy), and whose services and interest in the work ol editing
the writings os his namesake and collateral ancestor have been
ol the utmost value.
