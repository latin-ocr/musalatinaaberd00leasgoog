ΟΝ DR. WILLIAM FORBES.

LXI. DE GULIELMO FORBESIO, DOCTORE THEOLOGO.

Omnia mel vincit dulcedine, sidera lucem

Prae reliquis, robur missile fulmen habet.
Eloquium si quis Forbesi comparet istis

Mel fatuum, nigra sunt sidera, fulmen hebes.

3. Forbesi.] ‘⁴ Forbes” was, two hundredandfiftyyears agoadissyllable. ThisLatin
form seems clear prool that the abbreviating process, which hu made it, ao many now maleit,
a monosyllable‚ and which has given us Burns, with changed spelling, out ol Burness, had not
then taken effect. Similarlythe evidence inermes, thesartherbackone goes, aswitness Forbas‚
Forbassius (Collcclions, spald. ctus, 461, 503, 606), Forbeys, Forbace (Antioc. spaza. Club, 372,
405), and Buchanan’s Forbosius. This is corroborated by the jocular story ol last century
(d la Swist’s Andromache, etc.) as to the antiquity oi the Forbes tace, which was claimed on
the authority oi Ovid to be as old as the Trojan War, lor did not one say, ‘⁴ Olim Euphorbus
eram ” ll a good prool that a “Hugh Forbes ” was thecel An anticipation oi this jest occurs
in the play ol words in Robert Dounie's Greek epigram (contemporosy) on this bishop,
under the epithet εὔφορβος (Famis, p. 401)· Ariosto’s line (orl. 1²„ X. 87) also vouches
ior the original unclipt pronunciation‚ “ Signoreggia Forbesse il forte Armono”.
