ARGUMENT.

Errol‚ chieftein of the Hays, is gone, the world’s regret, who was once
ite pride. He war enrolled among the Peere through his stem of royal line,
ennobled by the blood-red ‘⁸ yokes'’. Martial virtue and a thousand trophies,
won by hio lightning-hand, linked him to the rhodes oi his forefathere. Piety

well proved bequeathed him to heaven. 1⁸ there aught beyond this, either
sor men to win or for heaven to give?

¹ Edmund Hoy, the Jesuit os Douay, a member oi Kinnoul or Meggins branch of Hays,

had great influence with the Earl ot‘ Errol (Geo. Crawt'urd's Chnnceliorr os Scotland, p. 157).
Seal os this Francis in Laing‘s Scnls, ΙΙ. Νο. 482.
