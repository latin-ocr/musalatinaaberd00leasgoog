Astonishment took hold of me, goddesS, at thy birth, and, under a new
light breaking, mine eyes were enchained by thine. Gems from the East at

first 1 deerned them; soon they seemed stars shot from their okyey spheres.

eyes, darting beams that burn and smite, the impos Venus says thou hast
stolen from him. Etr. ·

There follows s series oi twelve couplets each from Dunber and Johnston. brnuybrg wit

ABRENETHAEI FILIAE.

1. lousrorluu

Obstupui nuper Dea te nascente, novaque
Luce meos oculos detinuere tui.

ans primum rebar me cernere gemmas,
Mox sunt visa mihi sidera missa polo.

Error utrumque fuit: non urunt corpora gemmae, 5
Et magis obtusum sidera lumen habent.

Hos oculos, quibus una omnes urisque ferisque,
Te sibi ait Veneris surripuisse puer.
