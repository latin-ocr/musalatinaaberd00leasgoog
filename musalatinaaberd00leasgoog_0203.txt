CXVI. AD D. RICHARDUM METELLANUM.

Aurea dent alii, quae, Metellane, mereris
Munera, dent Tyrio coccina tincta cado.

Sunt mera verba mihi sine re, sine pondere voces,
Et numeri, sed nil, quod numerare queas.

Accipe Ionstono vetus hospes ab hospite nugas,
Munera muneribus non satis aequa tuis.

Tu Cereris, memini, tu Bacchi dona dedisti,
Nil ego Pierias adfero praeter aquas.

Sic aes vile tuo dum muto callidus auro,
Par Diomedis ego, tu mihi Glaucus eris.

4. Numeri] The “poetic numbers, “ os no account in banler's recleoning.
ro. Par Diomedis] Allusion to semi-comio incident in Illud, vl. 236.

1. ΟΝ DANIEL TILEN’S nwsLLIruo-Houss.

Daniel Tilen‚ the tutor ot' the great Turenne, called himself ‘⁴ Silesius‚”¹ beinganstive ol
Silene lle was a Professor of Theology with Arminian tendencies at &de author oi
numerous controversial works in Latin with dates between 1605 and 1⁶22, and a familiar
friend ol both hrthur and William Johnston. He hgures in the ⁴⁴ Amica Collatio” (published
1622), or “ Friendly Conference on Gracc and Free Will‚‘’ held between him and the famous
Scottish scholar and theologian camno, i.c.‚ John Cameron. who was the Calvinist professor
at Saumur. hs early as 1612 we find Dr. Donne writing frorn Paris (Worlts, Vol. Vl. p. 363)
about “certain opinions of Tilenus, a divine ol Sedan, with which the churches ol Franoe are
scandalised”. Tilenus, with a view to ingratiate himself with King james, made an atteck
on the Scottish Presbyterians in his Paraemsisadscotoenond.1620. ln 1622 appeared a
reply [by Sempill] to the paraenesis ol Tilenus, entitled Scoti τοῦ τυχόντος Paraclesis. ln the
prelsce the writer complains ol Tilenus's censores on his countrymen, and asks (alluding to
the Scottish thistle), ¹¹ si pungentes repungere Scotis non liceat ‘'. The relation oi Tilen to
Andrew Melville arrd to Sir James Sempill is well stated in James Paterson's Poems os ile
smptus inuitem, p. mvi.. suns. 1849. Tilenus nas ultimately to leave sesan becauoe
of his later anti-calvinistic opinions. See compliment to Tilen ssa preceptor in No. xxxvl.

¹A Georgius Tilenus, Silesius, is among the versihers in the Deliciae Post. Germanorum,
1612.
