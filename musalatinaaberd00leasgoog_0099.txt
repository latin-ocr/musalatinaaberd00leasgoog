ol three preachers beiore the Assembly ol 1616, being coupled with Rishop Patrick Forbes
and Archbp. Spottiswood (Boole os U. K ., p. 1116). Born 1585, he died in the spring oi1634,

p. 853 Jas. Bruoe'sEminent Men os Aberdeen, as also Vol. 11. oi Dr. Grub). Perhaps the
most remarkable tribute to Bishop William Forbes is the Latin poem (1⁶34) oi about two
hundred hexameters, giving account oi his various promotione, by Andrew Stephon, ¹⁸ School-
master oi Fetteresso,” reprinted in Mirr. Spottisw. Club, 1. 287. His Latin works, with a

Honey for sweetnessr, stare ior light, the thunderbolt ior force. The
eloquence oi Forbes, if likened to these elements, yet excels each in its
several power.

Ἀ kindred tribute may be noted to the same Dr. William Forbes, ior which we are
indebted to the late Rev. Dr. John Christie, who discovered it in MS. on a copy oi Forbes‘s
‘⁸ Considerationes,’‘ (Lond, 1658) in the University Library. It appears in Mr. Lippe’s Wodrow
volume (p. lxxvii.) in the New Spalding Club series. lt is initiallod ‘¹ D. L.,” probably David
taeech, whose name occurs among the Regents oi King’s college (1627), but the following
emendations are necessary: ln the eightb line, as printed, supply ratis before ipre ,· place full
stop aiter veum in line ten, also a comma aller loquela in line eleven. Part oi the interest
attaching to it is the remarkable evidence oi culture which it supplies asto the ease and
success with which Latin verse could then be cultivated in Aberdeen.
