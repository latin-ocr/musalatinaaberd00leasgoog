LXXIX. ΟΝ BlSHOP EUQOXUS’S DOVECOT.

secutam.

. The bishop's dovera, reared in a tower adjoining the cathedral‚ irave
forsaken the old haunts. The expelling cause was not the screech-owl or
a troop of nasty weasels‚ nor the sea-roar, nor the church bells' tinkle, nor
the rush of water gurgling by. No bird of Jove nor any hawk was dreaded.
’Tis the face of the austere bishop whereat the birds of Venus are afraid.

LXXIX. DE COLUMBARIO EUDOXI PRAESULIS.

Quas aluit templo turris vicina, columbae
Praesulis antiquos deseruere lares.
Non strigis has solitis exegit pupula nidis,
Nec mustelarum perniciosa cohors;
Nec pelagi murmur, nec tintinnabula templi
Proxima, nec strepitus praetereuntis aquae;
Nec circumvolitans magni Iovis armiger ales
Linquere Chaonias tecta coegit aves;
Rostra nec accipitris metuerunt: sola volucres
Cypridis austeri praesulis ora timent. 10
