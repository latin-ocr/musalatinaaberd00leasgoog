Epigrem thereon by John Johneton in Dr. G. Mnekenzie's Lim, 11. ⁴²5·

The noble town, formerly known ae eelurca of celestial affinity‚ now
rejoices aethe Mount of Roses. Α hill adjoins by which a river glidee: both
supply rich dainties to the people: salmon and whatever Nero's ponde ean
yield come from the waters, choice cattle from the hill. The banks are
fringed with lilies‚ refreshing to the eye, and the heights around glow with red
rosea. Eastward is the tributary sea, enlivened by countlese eails. The

Linlrs form the playground of the people, where some youths practise horse-
manship‚ some archery, othere the ‘⁸ putting '⁹ of the stone with Herculean arm.
Wrestling and quoits are here, and playing at ball with the croolted club. Α

{limyrae of thy beauties would wean Jove from his Capitol, Venus t'rom her
dalian haunts.
