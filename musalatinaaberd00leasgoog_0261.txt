What meane, 0 Charles‚ the golden band with rubies adorned which you
wear on your left limbi Is it mayhap an emblem of the heaven-girdling
pathway, which gay Cynthius pursues in his gilded circle? Or is it an image
of that path whereby the Halios the upper Powers ie climbed, and which is
white with your milk, 0 Juno [Cinxia] of the girdle? Or is it rather the
Nymph’e garter that elipped down of old? Here is my theory. With all the
world you are a captive in the chains of Love.

Aurea quid sibi vult Indis variata pyropis
Fascia, quam laevo, Carole, crure geris?
Tramitis an forsan caelum cingentis imago est,
Quem levis aurato Cynthius orbe terit?
Illius an species, Superum quo scanditur aula;
Quique tuo, Iuno cinxia, lacte nitet?
An potius Nymphae delapsa periscelis olim?
Hoc puto. Cum reliquis te quoque vinxit Amor.

Charles, why adom your shoulders with starry rays, you who have bearna
of more ethereal light within? Why does the Massylian Dragon gird your
breast, which feels kindly to all, than which there ie nought more mildi Why
have you bound your legs with the spoils of a British Nymph‚ you whose heart
burne with love to a French-bom Goddess? The Star betokens empire, the
Dragon a martial breast, but love of the [British] nation bids you bear the
Nymph's insignia.

Catule, cur radiis humeros stellantibus ornas,
Aetherei qui plus luminis intus habes?

Cur draco Massylus praecingit pectus, amicum
Omnibus, et quo nil mitius esse potest?

Cur spoliis Nymphae vinxisti crura Britannae,

Cui cor Francigenae flagrat amore Deae?
Arguit imperium sidus, draco Martia corda,
Ferre iubet Nymphae vincula gentis amor.
