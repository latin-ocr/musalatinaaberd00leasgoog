10. Ater 01² DANCING.

otico (asin No. cxx1v.‚ a, and in Sir John Davies’ ianciiul poem “ Orchestra ’') has
the dance been deerned an imitation ol the motion ol the heavenly bodies, and the moving
atomo ol the ballroom do, in a form, suggest, in its Epicurean and in its social sense, the
‘⁸ world ”. lt may be doubted, however, whether (even in ‘lom Moore (Poems, 1v., p. 319), or
in Soame Jenyns' charming lines in his ‘⁴ Art ol Dancing,” beginning: “ Where can philoso-
phere and nages wisc, Who read the curious volumes ol the siries,” eto), this notion has ever
been presented in happier lorm than in this little snatch ol Johnston.

Bchold our canopy the sky, which to all ministcrs their destiny; in your
mind’s eye survey the quires oi stars. atone time they spced last, anon they
move slow: at another they seem to stand still, and now again to move back·
wards fitfully. They part, unite; they sinlr and risc alost, as moved,1 wot,
by the pecten os the ethereal lyre. Here now take a look ol the quires ol
youths, and you may presumo that here the stars have either given or gotten the
lesson ol their own airy motions.¹

10. SALTATRIX.

Adspice, quo tegimur, caelum, quac fata ministrant
Omnibus: astrorum mente revolve choros.

Nunc properant, nunc lenta meant, nune stare putantur
Sidera, retrorsum nunc trepidare vides

Dissiliunt, coeunt, sidunt, tolluntur in altum,
Scilicet aethereae pectine mota lyrae.

Hic iuvenum specta choreas, et sidera gyros
Hic docuisse suos, vel didicisse, putes.
