LXXI. ΟΝ CARPE81U8’16ARDEN.

assultum.

Elsewhere one may gather pluma, with waxy bloom, and mulberry fruit,
and choice dement-apples, pears, cherries, chestnuts. Your garden yields
cloven leeks, green rnallows, cabbage-sprouts‚ lettuce‚ beet-root, common
kail. Two narcissi one may see, three curved irises, four lilies, five roses;
the rest are weeds and hemloclr, nettles and lerns. No need of Priapus
or a wakeful dragon to keep this garden. lts own poverty makes all secure.

2. ΟΝ THE SAME. t

Tiny garden, which Carpesius prizes as much as his own eyes, is the
smallest, poorest thing. A cobweb might hide it, or a flea jump over it, or a
frog, as it croalrs “koash” in the water. Ere Automedon could pull rein,

it could bedug up by a hungry dwarf. A poor merkel-gardener could hardly “

guther seeds that would fill a pigmy's palm. A breakfast sor a mouse ora
meal lor a grasshopper-nay‚ it would hardly give kail to the beggar Irus.
Yet Carpesius is as proud of it as of tho gardens of Alcinous. A quartan

sever we have read ol so heralded: little flea,2 in such suain ran your praise.

3. ou run snus.

'Tis wrong in me to jibe you, gardener lor poor Carpesius: the same
infirmity is mine. All along, the Aonian field, which l have cultivated from
infancy, has chested me. Your garden brings forth nettles and thistles:
mine gives its master only promises. I have given it the go by with

Phoebus, and the Muses to boot; say you the same, is you are wise.
“ Garden, good-bye.”
