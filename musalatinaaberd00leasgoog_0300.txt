CXL. ΟΝ THE DEATH OF JOHN GORDON, YOUNGER OF
BUCKIE. ·

(See No. CXXXII. 5.)

ARGUMENT.

Here rest Buckie's ashes. His mind, disdaining what is here below, takes
its course to the region which is its due dwelling. Mounting the ether he rises
above the axis of the sky, here where he has begun to enjoy the lace of Deity.
'Tis not of Lethe that he drinks, but pure nectar, nor doth darkness gird him
round, but an unsullied radiance. Far away in a melancholy vale, and among
the silent people‚ he sings hymns, which the winged choirs have taught him.
On earth he had sown his seed, in heaven is his harvest, and as victor he
now has the rewards of his sweltering toil. Lament sor those who have
reached only Elysium; as for a celestial, refrain from staining the choeks
with tears, whoe'er thou art that preferrest heaven to earth.

CXL. IN OBITUM IOANNIS GORDONII, DE BUCKIE
IUNIORIS.

Hic cinis est Bucki: mens dedignata quod infra est,
Ad loca virtuti debita carpit iter.

Aethera conscendens caeli supereminet axes,
Hic ubi iam coepit Numinis ore frui.

Non bibit hic Lethen, sed vivit nectare puro,
Nec cingunt tenebrae, sed sine faece nitor.

Valle procul maesta, populisque silentibus, hymnos
Concinit, aligeri quos docuere chori.

Fecerat in terris sementem, messis in alto est,
Et iam sudoris praemia victor habet.

Quos tenet Elysium defle; pro caelite, caelum
Quisquis humo praefers, tingere parce genas.
