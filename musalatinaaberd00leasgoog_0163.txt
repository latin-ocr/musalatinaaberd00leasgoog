CIII. ΟΝ MISS ABERNETHY,¹ WHEN SUFFERING FROM
A SKIN ΑΡΡΕΟΤΙΟΝ.ς

ARGUMENT.

Not long ago a brow ol ivory, lips oi coral, cheelrs ol rosea and liliee
mingled, drew all eyes. Now the fair lady's looks are matred by eruptione
over her young face. ’Twas Venus in jealousy that breathed this blight
She, though a goddess, could bear no rival, accounted, as she was, more
sair than either Jove'e daughter or Jove's spouee. ’Tis a cruelty lilre that
ol a Thracian or a Cyclop. lf there is no pity in thee as a femaleas a ’
mother, as a goddess, take a lesson in pity from the Latin she-wolf, and
learn to spate young children.

2. Oli THE SAME.

Venus, wishing to rob Miss Abernethy of her beauty, inserted with an
eruption brow, breast, lips and cheek. Her eyes remained unaffected, sharp
at once and clear-rhining. So the heavens disdain contagion that affecte
humanity, and the stare keep on their unvarying light.

3. ou rna saus.

Why did Cytherea sparo your eyes, isabella, when she tore with rough
nail your tendet cheelrs? She thought they were the lost eyes of her favourite
youth, ere he was rest away to breathe celestial air. Either she so believed,
or, Mirr lrabella, she keeps them ior her leman lover.

LhBORARET.
Frons ebori nuper certabat, labra corallis,
Pingebantque genas lilia mixta rosis.

Nunc Abrenethaeae tetro fluit ulcere vultus,
Et tenera infantis pascitur ora lues.
