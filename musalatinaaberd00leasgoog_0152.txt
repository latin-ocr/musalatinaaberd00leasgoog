XCIV. THE TOMB OF MONTGOMERY, A SCOTSMAN,
BISHOP OF MEATH IN IRELAND.

On this prelate see Misc. Spollirwoode clun, 1. roo; Trevelyon Papers (eamd. Sue),
Vol. 111. 25, where fifteen os his letters, rather lively, are published. The lrish names ol his
bishoprics seem to have puzzled Mrs. Montgomery as strange and barbarian: “The king
hath bestowed on him three lrish bishoprics. The names ol them 1 cannot remember, they
are so strange, except one, which is Derry. lpray God it may make us merry” (Treuelyorr

Paperr, 111. p. 78). ln John Leoch’s “Eclogae” (Leochaeus), the filib (p. 83) is addressed
¹· Georgio Montgomerio, Episcopo Medensi et Clophor ”.

Here is hidden, ol Montgomery‚ how poor a part! The remains ol such
a prelate, how small the mould that now concealsl ln twice two rcalms the
Montgomeries bear the palm among the nobles and the thousand captains
ol arms and gown. This tace, [Scotia] the landos the sons oi Fergus, doth
extol, and so doth ierne, and the several countries watered by the T hames
or the Garonne. But, lar as this heroic family outshines the rest, so lar
does he who lies here surpass his own tribesmen in renown.

XCIV. TUMULUS MONGOMMERI SCOT1‚ EPISCOPI
METHENSIS.

Hic Mongommeri tegitur pars quantulal Tanti
Praesulis exuvias quantula velat humusl

Bis geminis proceres gens Mongommeria regnis
Praestat, et armorum mille togaeque duces.

Hanc Fergusiadum tellus, hanc iactat Ieme,
Quodque rigat Tamesis, quodque Garumna solum.

Sed quantum reliquas haec gens heroa, tribules,
Qui iacet hic, tantum vincit honore suos.

3. Bis Geminis] This is explained by the lines five and six, indicating what is
meant by the “four realms’'. He was a scion ol the House ol Efflinton.
