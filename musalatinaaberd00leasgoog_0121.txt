LXXVII. TO THE PLEADERS AT THE BAR, NOT TO
BETRAY THE ROYAL CAUSE.

This poem. aa appearing in the edition os 1632. is probably aimed at the English Tawyers,
who were by that time bury assailing the prerogativa. The Scottirb embroglio with the king
up to 1637 turned on ecclesiastica! rights rather than parliamentary and legal privileges.

ARGUMENT.

Frequenter of courts and Themia’ realur, daub not the face of the king.
Hands os thunder he can stretch afar. Cease to pluck the beard ofthe
sleeping lion. Claws he har, to protect that heard.

LXXVII. AD CAUSIDICOS, NE PRODANT CAUSAM
REGIAM.

Qui fora, qui Themidem colis, os ne subline Regi;
Fulmineas longe porrigit ille manue.

Vellere sopito barbam desiste leoni,
Hic ungueS, barbam qui tueantur, habet.
