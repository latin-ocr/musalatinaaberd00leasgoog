ENCOMIA URBIUM. 255

CLXVI. EPIGRAMS IN HONOUR OF SOME OF THE MORE

FAMOUS CITIES AND TOWNS OF SCOTLAND. .
This series appears first in the Middelburg edition, 1642. Reprinted by Skese in his

¹⁸ succinet survey ol the famous city ol Aberdeen,” John Forbes, 1⁶85. Α handation ol the
group into English was made by J. B. [John BarclayJ, minister at Cruden, who however
adopted an order ol his own, placing Aberdeen first. His version is rather poor, as is seen lrom
the specimen given under No. 17. On J. B.. see collectiores (Sp. Cb), p. sm also Maidment's
Scottish Elegiae Verres, p. 14.—This series ol poems is an imitation, in ancient literature, ol
Ausonius in his “Galam” ol the cities ol the empire, and, in modern Latin literature, ol
Julius Caesar Scaliger in his series ol ¹¹ Urbes '' (Del. Poet. Ital, Vol 11.). So Johnston’s
lriend, Caspar Barlaeus, has a group ol Dutch towns similarly treated, beginning with
Dordrechtum (Dort), Harlemum, etc. (Barlaei, Miscellanea, p. 201).

Arthur Johnston alludes to this performance ol his in the poem (see Nc. CXLIV.) to
his friend William Spang, who published thern in the collected edititm ol 1⁶4²·

lt is somewhat odd that while Lowland Scotland is fairly well represented in this series,
Inverlochy near Ben Nevis, in the heart ol the Highland region, should have been in those
days within the lren ol the writer; and that Arbroath, the city oi the great abbey, in the centre

ol the Lowlands, is leit out.

In some editione ol camden these epigrams are erroneously ascribed to John Johnston,
the kinsman ol Artbur, who, though hailing from Aberdeen, lived most ol his time at St.
Andrews. lt is true that a series ol similar Latin epigrams to Scottish towns appears in Dr.
George Mackenzle’s Lines os Scottish Writers and in connection with the Liie cl Hector
Boece in Vol. 11., but those appearing there are clearly assigned (11. p. 419) to the
Johnston who was P10lessor ol Divinity at St. Andrews Still the series by John Johneton is
interesting, although the sketches are as a rule not equal to those from the pen ol Arthur.
The evidence derivable from the poenis Nos. CXLIV. and CLXVI. 20, is conclusive as to
Artbur being author ol those in the Middelburg edition.

1. EDINBURGH.

The stateliness and beauty ol Edinburgh are pertrayed with pride. Holyrood and the
Castle form the extremes; the Parliament House and St. Giles' lill up the middle ol the
picture, and the whole has lor centre the crown ol St. Giles'. Yet three other ol the towns
have longer tributes. Another ol the same by John Johnston on Edinburgh is lound in
Machenzie's Scottirls Writers, 11. p. 402. Compare also the earlier sketch ol Edinburgh by
our author in Vol. 1. pp. 42-3·

To enjoy her heavenly view, Edina rises on her sloping ridge, looking
down on rich domains of Ceres and the N ymphs and eke on the tributary sea.
To the East under Arthur's Seat the Palace is beheld. To the West the Castle
commanda the city with its thunderbolts of war. In the midst there stands s
temple, ornament ol the city and the world, the abode ol Piety: resplendent
within and surmounted by s regal crown of fretted stone. The abode ol'
Justice adjoins, worthy of Polycletus and Praxiteles. The burghers dwell in
noble mansione fit for heroes and sear no threats of danger. Tiber puts Rome
in terror, and the sea threatens Venice: at such'threats Edins smiles. No
city worthier ol the sceptre; no site more suited lor the lordship ol the land.
