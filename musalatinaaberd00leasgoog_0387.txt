ΙΝΟΟΜΙΑ URBIUM.

Hic fugit, hic sequitur, victori praemia cedunt
Quae palmas superant, Elidis ora, tuas.

Hic ego sum, memini, Musarum iactus alumnus,
Et tiro didici verba Latina loqui.

Carmine Maeonio veteres tollantur Athenae,
Urbs haec versiculis est celebranda meis.

13· Mutunus] The poet got his grounding in mein at Sebool os Kintore, not, as we
might heve expected, at the much nearer Inverurie. The town os Kintore, though at some
distance from Caakieben, was in those days more important than Inverurie, and benoe it still
bes the honour os giving the First title to the Keith·Falconer family, now ownera of the
original Caskieben, while inverurie oontributes the Second or courtesy Title to thet family.
In 1⁶0⁶ we bear oi efforts made to supply inverurie with a Grammar Sebool (Davidson's
Garioch, p. ηις), but this was aher Artbur Johnston had reached eollege.

My beloved town, Ury laves thee with gentle waves and hence thy·

ancient name. Don,''tbo‚ wasbes thee with crystai stream, to be swelled by
Ury and her tribute os Gstioch waters. Why rise no proud edifices with rich
columns, no Pyramid terimith thy titles to renown i Why rises the rowan
tree, where should be by righxhe laurel? 'Twas near to thee that Bruce,

who had tin then been beaten, ., t pounded to the dust his foe, and was victor
everywhere thereafter. Not far irom hence, too, Stewart's strong right arm
broke the rebel clans, and steeped in blood the clay of Harlaw. Ι may feel
pride in thee; the land that blesses thee with rich abundance adjoins my
natal spot. Beside thee 1 drew as a boy the first breath os heaven's vital air:
beside my cradle 1 wish to close my eyes and die.
