‘ris Beton's likenesa yon behold; his breathing image is before yon,
representing, aa is meet, at onoc the sage ot' Cos and him ot' Pergamus. He
ol Cos was physician to kings; the other to Caesar oi the Capitol: this was
likewire a royal physician and imperial too. While the elever painter strives
to represent the rest, his art dotli lail, and the oenvas shows no triding short·
ooming. Giited with so many languages‚ such faculty oi brilliant speech, the
subject ol his art yet seems here to lack all voice Again the painter failed
when lte varnished outwardly that breast which lmows no varnish at all within.

CXLV. DE EFFIGIE D. DOCTORIS DAVIDIS BETONII,
MEDICI REGII.

Adspicis effigiem Betoni‚ spirat imago
Iure simul Coum Pergameumque senem.
Cous erat regum, Tarpeii Caesaris alter,
Regius hic medicus caesareusque fuit.
Cetera dum sollers conatur reddere pictor,
Deficit ars, tabulae nec levis error inest.
Cui tot sunt linguae, dicendi tanta facultas,
Et nitor, hic omni voce carere vides.
Hic quoque deliquit pictor, cum pectora luco
Oblevit, luci quae nihil intus habent. 10

serenes, glamour, disguire, salsehood.
