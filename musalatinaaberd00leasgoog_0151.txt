XCIII. ΟΝ THE SLAUGHTER OF WILLIAM GORDON OF
ROTHIEMAY AND GEORGE GORDON.

'I'he occasion is thus dacribed by Spalding (Truhks, 1. 13), the root oi the ieud being
aqumet about salmon suhings: ‘⁴ Upone the first oi Januar, 1630. the laird of Frendraucht
and his complices iell in ane truhiii with Williame Gordon oi Rothimay and his complices,
quheir the said Williame wes unhappilly sicsine, being a gallant gentilnssn3 and on Fren-
draucht's syde was slayne George Gordoun, brother to James Gordon ot' Lesnroir: and divers
utheris wes hurt on both sydis”. This was the beginning oi the serious ieud that resulted in
the uagedy oi the burning of Frendraught. ¹Sir Robert Gordon (H. os Eoris os Setheriand,
p. 419) was conversam with the events et the ssrne, which he has Iully related Hc acted as
a peccemaker, and refers to a scene where “dl parties having shaken hands in the orchard
oi snabogie. they were [thought to be] hartflie reconciied”. But the tire ot' Frendraught
darkened that hope. See under XLIX. and ἰ. oi Vol. I.

Two Gordons ieii in jarring war, oid warriors both, and each a captain
oi brave youths. Mars embroiled them, and death carries them alone away;
their band, by good fortune, escaped. Learn fortune from their eorumden,
but from thern iearn to dash boldly on the soe-yea, ye brave youths,
unflinchineg to die

XCIII. DE GULIELMO GORDONIO ROTHIMAEO, ET
GEORGIO GORDONIO CAESIS.

Gordonii cecidere duo discordibus armis,
Ambo senes, iuvenum ductor uterque ruit.
Miscuit hos primos Mavors, mors abstulit unos,
Evasit comitum, sorte favente, cohors.
Fortunam ex sociis, ex his audacter in hostem
Ducere, constanter disce, iuventa, mori.
