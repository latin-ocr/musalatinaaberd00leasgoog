ΟΝ DOCTORS FORBES AND BARON.

LXIV. ΟΝ WILLIAM FORBES AND ROBERT BARON,
ABERDEEN DOCTORS OF DIVINITY.

(On William Forbcs, sce No. LXI. abovc‚· audon Robcrt Baron,
see No. XLI. of Vol. Ι.)

Το Forbes as pastor of Christ’s flock the world has no peer, nor any to
compare to Baton. In eloquenc'e both are equal‚ with this only difference,

that, while the latter sweetly attracts men’s minds, the former by power
propels.

LXIV. DE GULIELMO FORBESIO ET ROBERTO BARONIO,
THEOLOGIS ABREDONENSIBUS.

Nil, quod Forbesio, Christi dum pascit ovile,
Nil, quod Baronio comparet, orbis habet.

Eloquio sunt ambo pares; discrimen in uno est;
Quo lubet, hic mentes pellicit, ille rapit.
