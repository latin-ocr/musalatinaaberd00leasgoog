4. xsrxououv.

Astraea now returns, and leaving her celestial seats enters your realms,
O Charles, which are blest by you with peace. Rightly the virgin reappearing
places herself under the king's wings, who is peerless in the world lor worth and
equity. Rightly she hath left the heaven: since your merits mount to the ,
stara, she counts you more worthy of these abodes. Worthy though you be
thereos, yet the virgin Astraea and all the earth beseech heaven suppliantly that

it may belong ere you ascend to those high abodes.

4. asraouourx.

Nunc redit, et superos linquens Astraea penates,¹
Quae tu pace beas, Carole, regna subit

lure redux virgo Regis se subiicit alis,
Quo melius, quo nil aequius orbis habet.

lure polum liquit: meritis cum sidera tangas,
Te magis his dignum iudicat illa locis.

Sis licet his dignus, tamen haec te scandere sero
Virgo rogat supplex, totaque terra Deos.

3. Virgo] i.e., Astraea, the goddess ol Justice.

5. osousrxv.

My compass measures the mighty world, and whatsoever meets the eye
in sea or shore; in scales are weighed the masses ol sea and the vast earth
and the buried realm of Dis. Yet great Heaven has given you,0 Charles,
realms too small, and the earth is too narrow ior your throne. Democritus,

who of old imagined countless worlds, would say they could be ruled with
only you as Jove supreme.

5. unowanus.

Dum meus immensum metitur circinus orbem,
Inque solo quicquid comitur, inque salo:
Dum maris et vastae trutinantur pondera terrae,
Et quidquid Ditis regna sepulta tenent:
Parva tibi nimium Di magni regna dederunt,
Et minor est solio, Carole, terra tuo.
Qui prius innumeros finxit Democritus orbes,

Diceret hos uno te love posse regi.
