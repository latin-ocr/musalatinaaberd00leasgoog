EPIGRAMMA·

10. Jouusrou.

Forgive the bard: ere long the offending paper will pay the penalty, lor
presuming to murmur against the mighty powers. The firee which it insulted
will turn it into ashes, and the ashes will experience avenging wetere. lf the

bard is to pay the penalty condign, Phoebus and the Muses make thie nequest,
that if Arthur ia not to you what of old he was, you, Tilen‚ may condescend
to be to him what you have been.

10. lONSTONUS.

Da veniam vati, meritas mox improba poenas
Charta dabit, magnis obstrepere ausa Deis.
In cinerem vertent, quibus insultaverat, ignes,
Et cinis ultrices experietur aquas.
Aut si, quam meruit, vati quoque poena luenda est, 5
Unum hoc te Phoebus Pieridesque rogant:
Ut, tibi si non est Arcturus, quod luit olim,
llli tu, quod eras, esse, illene, velis.

11. TlLEN.

Arthur had said [cf. No. 1 above] that no disaster from Vesta nor any
from Doris was to be dreaded by this hearth and home. Ere long the bard
under another spell [cs. Palinodia‚ No. 2] changed his tune and uttered lore·
bodings dire. Even those who are in youth's green innocence can know that
a poet’s words, so little consistent with himself, deserve no credence. Apollo
redeems him now lrom some Circe’s spell‚ and teaches him to ulter truth.
Since you, Arthur, have recovered your old lrame, deem that my old affection

for you has returned.
