Johnston by his serviceslaid under obligation the Lords os Council‚
and through his medical help the sicli man, Grant, revived. A pleader may
serve a client and charge no fee, nor do bought words help a panel more
than “ bunkum '' does. Medicine, haid sor, is good, but does harm, is you
decline to pay for it: Thessalian druge are not more noxious. Either grant
ye the sees which Johnston earned, or Grant shall swim the Styx before hia
time.

LXXVIII. AI) SENATUM, DE IACOBO GRANTIO.

Praebuit obsequium Patribus IonetonuS, et aeger

Grantius illius vivere coepit ope.
· Causidieo fas est gratis servire clienti,

Nec magis empta reum, quam data verba, iuvant.

Empta iuvat medicina, nocet, si solvere nolis,
Thessala nec peius toxica virus habent.

Aut date, quae meruit lonstonus‚ praemia PatreS,
Aut Styga tranabit Grantius ante diem.

4. Data verba] This is a severe hit at the lawyers and their “famiehed win' ”.

7. Patren] Is these are the Lords os Session in Edinburgh, perhaps the “Grani’'
referred to may be the notorious James Grant oi Carroun who figures so prominently in
Spalding, and who was more than once ‘⁴ wardit ’' in the prison os Edinburgh¹ where Johnaton
may have been called in, as a doctor, to prescribe.
