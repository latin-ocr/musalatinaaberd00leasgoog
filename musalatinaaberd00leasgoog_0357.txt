Ο martial raee, desrer than my lise to me, why this madness os civil
broii? Let the Rhine and Elbe give witness as to its horrors. Germsny
was once a land of peaoe and plenty, learning and the Muses. Mars has
laid it waste, and saith and piety have fied. Shun such whirlpools‚ 0 landos
Fergus; thou hast all the resources oia happy peopIe, but Mars once lighting
his torch will, consume thy felicities. A long period ol repose has blunted thy
energies sud rusted thy arms, snd then, where are the sinews of war? There
is no Pactolus running sands os gold sor thee, and ii we take away thy herds
and crops and the produce of thy nete, thou hast no money to pays soldier.
Nor hast thou fortified towns or fleets and thuoderbolts oi cannon, and, where
a thousand are as good the one as the other, there may be a feud as to who is
to be commander. The king, who is of Scottish blood, bids thee, my Scotia,
obey. There is still room for pardos, and Charles offers such spontaneously.
So count it base to dip thy sword in the blood of brothers; turn thy arms
against some externa] enemy: thy present madness is because thou art with·
outa proper foe.
