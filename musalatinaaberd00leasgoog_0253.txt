' shuns the dames, she who presides over them, a Goddess than whom none is

more airy or more nimble? Why does she, a starexceliing Goddess‚ iear a
Goddess' looks, and gleam with the proud light oi her golden-haired brother?
isit before this Princess that the Goddess seara to show fictitious curls or
painted cheeks? No cause ior sear lest she should be thought less than fair:
the Moon may, in a mask, lead on the dances.¹

Dum celebrat Regina choros, se Cynthia terris
Subtrahit et fratris lumine mersa later.

Dic, choreas cur Diva fugit, quae praesidet illis,
Et qua nec levior mobiliorve Dea est?

Ora Deae cur Diva timet, quae sidera vincit,
Fratris et auricomi luce superba nitet?

An mendicatos hac coram Principe cirros,
An metuit pictas prodere Diva genas?

Nulla metus causa est, ne non formosa putetur,
Personata potest ducere Luna choros.

The sky was lately tight-bound with Boreul frost, the streame chained up
with icc, the fieids buried in snow. Now the air is ianned by zephyrs, the
wave is smooth ior the ship's keel; the ground with rich grass laughs and
smiles. 'Tis the stars, 0 Prinoess, that applaud your dances, and the rest os
the world keeps holiday in unison with you.

¹Compare‚ in the same vein, Sir John Davies on the ‘¹ Dances oi the Moon ” :-
“ Who doth not see the mensures os the Moone,
. Which thirteene times she daunceth every yeare i
And ends her pavine thirteen times as soone
As doth her brother, oi whose golden haire
She horroweth part, and proudly doth it weare;
Then doth she coyiy turn her sace aeide,
Then halfe her cheek is scarse sometimes descried.’'
Daviee’ Orchestra, st. 4¹·
