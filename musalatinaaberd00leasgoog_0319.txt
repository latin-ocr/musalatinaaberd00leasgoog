CLII. 2. VENUS TO MINERVA.

Annonam.

Pallas' letter, which is less than sisterly, 1 have read, and my blind son
has listened. He laughed, but 1 blushed. As sor the kisses I received from
Mars and Adonis, what are they to the kisses, countless as the waves, lavished
by great Jove? I grudge thee not thy spear; why 'envy me arrd my son our
dart? As sor thy birth without a mother, Mars is a sorr without a sire, but
he has felt Love's sorrow in his breast. Thou boastest of thy chastity; easy
boast, where no one sues thee ς who could love those Gorgon snakes around
thy shield? My husband Vulcan made proof of thy virtue. The chest os
Erichthonius but ill conceals a tale against thee. But, granting thou art
chaste, why put straits upon thy votaries? Love enters into the campos
wan ss witness all the warriors, Achilles and the rest; each had his spouse or
lady-love. Or, again, let us take thy artistic craft of spindle and loom. Love
ventures in there as well, and Penelope over her web often said, UlysseS, corne.
Is the band oi Phoebus alone to know no nuptial ties? Diana is less severe;
virgin though she be, she is fair and equable to men; for Cephalus and
Procris, among her devotees, succumbed to my darts. The Muses have not
been always barren, as witness Calliope. The ruler of the Lyceum, Aristotle,
owned my sway. Among the poets, what would Ovid, what would Catullus,
yea, what would Sappho have been without the flame of my inspiring power?
1t Hymen brings some troubles the exclusion of Hymen brings more and
worse. llls there may be, but bear them like Socraten, and if more than
moral force is needed, why, thou hast spear and shield and all warriors¹
weapons With them protect thy votaries.
