Epigram on same byjohn Johnston in Dr. G. Mackenzie'e Lines, ll. 4²7· Compare this
poem with the similar but more modest tribute to the same city in No. LIV. ln poems oi
this sort a certain lieence was allowed, rising into extravagance at the close.

The New Town, enriched by the mouth of the fish-abounding Dee, from
ancient cities bears away the palm. ’Tis blessed by shrines famous o'er all the
world and temples erected by no mortal hund. Beside this rises the sbode oi
the Latin Muses, and not iar off from thence is seen Athene’s seat. High in air
blaze the starry pinnacles of the Town-House Hall, where extends also the
ample stretch oi plainstones in the Market-place. Here one discovers the
sky-compeering Palace of the Magistrates, with the people's tutelary powers
gleaming in colours and in gold. Why mention the triple hille, the three
bulwarlrs of the town, like the hills oi the Imperial city Rome? lt has the
Woolmanhill besides ior ornament, of fairer mien than these, and brightened
by Spa’s chalybeate wetere. From it you look down on Jameson's suburban
ginden, whose flowers one takes to be painted by its master's hand The Dee
brings shoals of salmon, and the sea brings thy treasures, 0 Egypt, and the
wealth of Ind. Α bridge with seven arches spans the Dee ; the mitre marks
its founder. These are things sor the common people to celebrate3 'tis the
burghers themselves l praise, as unsurpassed in merit. Brave hearts are
theirs and golden virtue, and tried and tmsted honesty; hospitable they are
and kind and courteous as the angele, while the wealth that is master oi others
is but a servant to them. To give virtue its due, the city should be styled
Queen, and justly bear the title of the Lady of the Land. Other towns bring
forth mere mortale ; Aberdeen is mother of heroic men

17. ABREDONIA Nova

Urbs nova piscosi quam ditant ostia Devae,
Urbibus antiquis praeripit omne decue.

Hanc delubra beant totum cantata per orbem,
Templaque mortali non fabricata manu.

Haec prope, Romuleis aedes sacrata Camenis
Surgit, Athenaeum non procul inde vides

3. Delubra] The churches evidently oi St. Nicholas and Greyiriars.
5. Romuleis] Probably the Grammar and Song Schools.
6. Athenaeum] Marischal College.
