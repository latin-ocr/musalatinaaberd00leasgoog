CXLIX. ΟΝ THE EARL OF HOLLAND.

exeuntem.

Behold with what foolish pursuits the courtier passes life along: one rears
hawlrs, this other hounds; one set pampers horses, another rejoices in the
dance; one colours his cheeks with rouge, another with wine. This one is
wiped clean of caeh by a boxer, that by a courtesan and an actor; others there
are whose wealth is wasted by gaming all night long. Higher soars Rich, the
heir of generous racc, because enamoured with Apollo’s lyre. The Muses
whom he chenshes, he also protects with gilded wings, and his joy is to
plead for the Aonian quire. The youth of Parnassus follow him as their
dictator and offer suppliantly due incense to their chief. Ye Muses, give us
back Horace, restore us Maro: Britain has now produced another Maecenas

CXLIX. DE COMITE HOLLANDIO.

Adspice quam studiis vitam traducat ineptis
Aulicus, accipitres hic alit, ille caneS,

Una saginat equos, gaudet pars una choreis,
Iste genas fuco purpurat, ille mero.

Hunc pugil, hunc meretrix emungit et histrio nummis
Sunt quibus et pernox alea vastat opes.

Altius assurgit generosi sanguinis heres,
Richaeus, Clariae captus amore lyrae.

Quas colit, auratis Musas hic protegit alis,
Gaudet et Aonio dicere iura choro.

Hunc dictatorem sequitur Parnassia pubes
Fertque suo supplex debita tura duci.

Reddite Pierides Flaccum, revocate Maronem,
lam Maecenatem terra Britanna tulit.

title was revived and conferred upon Baron Rich of Leeze. The last Earl of Warwiclr and
Holland died in 1759 (Engl. Encycl.,· Biogr. in Worwick). See also note on No. VIlI. 70.

shire (Nichols' Progn, 4·1oo5).
