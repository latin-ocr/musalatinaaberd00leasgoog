Among the Bacon Letters (ll. p. 205, edition, London. 1837) is acharming note addressed
to this Sir James Fullerton. when in charge ol the affairs ol Prmce Charles. He had been sur·
veyor ol the lands to Prinee Charles when Duke ol York. and was groom ol the stole to him alter
he becameking as Charles l. Compare the epigram by John Leech (Leochaeus, p. 23), ‘⁴ Jacobs
Fullartono equiti ab intimis Caroli Principis consiliis’'. Plura in Niehols' Progressa, l. 4⁶1,
and Corrcspondcncc os Jumes VI. (Camd. Soc), p. xlvii, on Fullerton, groom ol the stole to
Charles l. (regarding whom see Grosart's Phincos Fletcher, 11. p. 5; epitaph on, in Epitoplu

ol the Tullibardine Murrays, and rose to he Provost ol Eton (M‘Crie’s Life os Melone, p. 316).
In 1623 Thomas hlurrny, who was first tutor, theu secretary, to Charles 1.. “deyetl some dayes
alter he was cutt ol the stone ” (Sir J. Ballour's Mem.. 11. 97). Interesting glimpse ol Murray
in statement ol Archbishop Abbot (N iehols' Progresscs. lll. 82, also 775), but the most notable
circumstance is that no less a person than Francis Bacon, Lord Veruhm, when under the cloud
ol his missortunes‚ applied lor the succession to Thomas Moray, in these words: “ Mr. Thomas
Murray, whom l love very well, is like to die. lt were a pretty call lor my lottune '⁹ (Baton's
Works‚ ll. p. 251).

ARGUMENT.

Disdaining the court’s or kings complainings, Fate has carried away
Moray ere his time. After the removal of that star, Fullerton was drowned
in Lethe's untimely surge. Let Lachesis rage at will: alter such sad deaths,
nor court nor king can mourn.

Hellen, whose autobiography has been published by the Camden society, and gives interesting
glimpses of lise among the fugitive Royalists in the Cromwell time at Fyvie Castle in Aberrleen·
shire and elsewhere.
