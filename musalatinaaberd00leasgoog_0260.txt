ln wearing the diadema of three realrna, you, charles, are greater than
your sires. Wholrnows not that? The precluus Garter binde their left leg-
the Garter which is still and glancing with many-coloured geme. The Dragon
bristles up his neck and breast, and his glittering back the radiant Knight trans·
fixes with gilded spear. The star shining on your shoulder unlolds ita bearn:

’ Isuspoet it is the star either of Jove or the Paphian Goddess. A nymph gave

the Garter, a British chief gave to your sires a Dragon's apoll, but ’tie heaven
that holds out to you the stars.

Triplicis imperii qui fers diademata, magnis
Quis te maiorem, Carole, nescit avis?

Crus ligat his laevum pretiosa periscelis, auro
Quae riget et gemma multicolore nitet.

Colla gravat pectusque draco, cui lucida terga
Gemmeus aurata cuspide figit Eques.

Stella tuo fulgens humero iubar explicat; astrum
Aut Iovis aut Paphiae suspicor esse Deae.

Nympha periscelidem, spolium dux Britto draconis
His dedit, astra tibi porrigit ipse polus.

England of old triumphed over the Lion, and wore his hide.along with
your spoils, 0 British N ymph. Charles bears on his shoulder a star second
to none in lustre‚ and sheds thence a golden radiance. Either he has drawn
down the stars from the Pole, like another Circe, or here is a new Atlas
propping up the stars of the sky.

Prisca triumphati gestavit terga leonis
Anglia, cum spoliis Nympha Britanna tuis.

Fert humero stellam nulli fulgore secundam
Carolus auratum spargit et inde iubar.

Aut hic astra polo deduxit, ut altera Circe,
Aut novus hic caeli sidera fulcit Atlas„
