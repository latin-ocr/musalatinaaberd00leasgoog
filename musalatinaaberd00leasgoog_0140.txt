LXXXVI. ΟΝ ΑΝ ANATOMICAL DISSECTION, EXHIBITED
AT PADUA BY JULIUS CASSERIUS OF PLACENTIA.

It is pleasant to corne upon this gem, in which piety, seience‚ poetry meet and corn-
mingle. The poet stands transfixed in admiration at a demonstration by Casserio in the dis-
secting theatre ol Padua‚ which was, in the poet's time, the greatest of the anatomical schools.
Casserio is still famous as an anatomist‚ anda ganglion is named alter him. He was born
in 1545, and died in 1616. On thelame ol Padua as a scientific school in Johnston's time,
see Ch. Knight's Shaksp„ 1. 291.

annuum.

Let the vulgar crowd, or whoever gape aster elephanta and the like,
admire the amphitheatre. Whoso loves Phoebus, or whom Phoebus loves,
prefers Ο Kaiser, Casserian sights to thy Caesarean [imperial] pageants.
There one can 'see what miracles the world in a finger-breadth contains, and
in one’s face we get a glimpse of God’s own face and rnien. Here Nature's
masterpiece, unsurpassed, is by a dexterous hand unveiled. The eloquent
tongue, accomonnying, interprets; Nature listens to the discourse‚ and learns
to become conscious of her own wondrous laws. Brenthes there a man both
dull and dead at these revealments os the Antenorian theatre—such a one
lacks both eyes and ears, Else‚ supposing him to have got from indulgent
Nature these sense-organa, he has a heart as senseless as an Abderite.

Happy souIS, whose bodies are shown under dissection by the knight of
Placentia anrid the theatre's applause. Your names he will insert in scrolls
destined to live for ever, and both hemispheres will read your praises. But,
if ye prefer this mortal life, descend again from heaven. The hands that
dissected will re·erect your framea.
