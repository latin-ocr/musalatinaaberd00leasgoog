10. ΟΝ THE SAMB whxmox's JOUSTING wmr Tute selcha.

Who oi the celestials, 1 ask, whirls the spear in a people’s view and
wields the Thessalian captain’s arins? With might invincible a huge ash is
tossed, bigger and weightier than the spear from Pelion. Now he holds it
ercet: anon he sways it by the middle; then against the foe he directs it with
warlilre hand. Sometimes he projeets it forward, anon he snatches it back lest
it slip from hand; and it fears no bronze, lor so we see it is armed. He fetches
a stroke, he parries, makes leint, makes flight, pours in blow on blow. Neither
Pollux as a pugilist nor Eryx could have surpassed him. Light loot is his;
keen eyes, nimble hands both; his brow is full ol lrowns but yet as smooth aa
snow. Mars can wield the spear and socan his Tritonian sister; but our
warrior cannot be deemed either Mars or Mars’ lierce sister. In skill
Gordon outshines the God, in strength the Goddess: in might ol spirit, ii we
compare them, he surpasses both.

10. DE musnet( HASTILUDIO·

Quis rogo caelicolum populo spectante sarissam
Vibrat, et Aemonii ventilat arma ducis?
Viribus invictis quassatur fraxinus ingens,

Qua minor et levior Pelias hasta fuit.
Nunc tenet erectam, mediam nunc librat, in hostem
Nunc bellatrici dirigit ille manu.
Proiicit interdum, mox, ne ruat, occupat hastam,
Nec, quibus armatam cernimus, aera timet.
Excipit, eludit, simulat, fugit, ingerit ictus
Nec pugil hunc Pollux, nec superasset Eryx.
Pes levis est, acres oculi, manus utraque prompta,
Plena minis frons est, sed tamen aequa nivi.
Mars hastile gerit, soror et Tritonia, credi
Mars tamen, aut Martis trux soror ille nequit.
Arte Deum superat GordonuS, robore Divam,
Ingentes animos confer, utrique praeit.
