ARGUMENT.

Yield the palm, O snowwhite bird of Sthenelus, to the Caledonian
swan. Thou shunnest, but he seeks, communion with the sky3 thou
weepest‚ never ceasing: in his weepiug there are gleams of jesting. Thy
whiteness is without: his within: one charm thou hast, but he bears a
thousand charms.

LXXXIII. DE ANDREA MELVINO.

Cede Caledonio volucris Stheneleia cygno,
Quae reliquas niveo corpore vincis aves.

Tu fugis, ille petit caeli commercia; tu fles
Perpetuo, fletum temperat ille iocis.

Tu forie, ille intus candorem possidet. Unam
Tu Venerem, Veneres mille sed ille vehit.

1. Stheneleia] Cycnus = swan (Ov., Met, 11. 367) is the son oi Sthenelus—Proles
Stheneleia Cycnus. Cf. Volucrem Sthcmleida=“swan” (Ov., leid, Xll. 581). (ln Ov.,
uer, IX. 273,·Stheneleius is, rather irregularly, based on Sthenelus; otherwise we should
expect the base to be Sthenelc or Stheneleus.)

3. 'I'u fugis] The swan's liking for earth and water, and hating sky and flame
(nec secretoque Iouique credit), was accounted sor by the legend ol Phaethon, with which
the story os Cycnus is brought by ovid into close connectIon.
