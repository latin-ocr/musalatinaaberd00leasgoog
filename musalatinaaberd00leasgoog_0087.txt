LVI. ΟΝ THE BRACELET OFFERED TO HER SPOUSE
ΒΥ MARIE DE LA TOUR.¹

(See under preceding, No. LV.)

ARGUMENT.

· Gems form one part of your bracelet, the other is a loclr of hair; both in

luntre gleaming. The geme came from Venus' shell, the same wherein she
mc wafted to the Cyprian shore. Their pearly whiteneue ie rival to the
moon: smooth and round they are, like the globe itself or the milky breast
of Venus. The loclr of hair a nymph supplied: beside the wavee of the
Meuue ct sedan, Love wove with these his toils for the bridegroom. 'Tic
in hue like umber or gold or crocus enamelling Cilician meads. In finenese

it rocella fine linen or the filaments of sille Neither the eilkworm wcaving
ite cocoon about its own bowe1s‚ nor the creature that weaves with ite ioot
ite cunning workmnnehip, nor the Lemnian blncksmith with all his art, ie
more deit and cunning. ’Tis either a loclr sent from Berenice’s brow, ora
curl of Venus, or a trees of thy beams‚O sun.
