LXXXIV. ΟΝ TAURELLUS’S MONKEY.

This fashion ol apes as pets was not uncommon in that age. Goethe's explanation ol
it is interesting (Eckerman¹s conversations, 1. 427). Even in her sorrows, the Princess
Elizabeth ol Bohemia so amused herself (Green's Lines of Prinoessa, V. 288).

ARGUMENT.

Great Alexander and pious Augustus each dropt a tear over a dead
steed. Egyptians mourned a crow, the Romans a raven, and Atalanta
blushed not to weep over her dog. ln Taurellus’s bream, affection was no
less strong: a monkey's winding-sheet proved a theme for sorrow.

2. ΟΝ THE SAME MONXEY.

In lise it liked the men, though itself a female, and always dislilted
and snarled at the soster sex. Yet 'twas they that wept at its funeral
rites, which the men sustained with cheelrs all dry. Compare now the
sexes, you captious critic: in the one you have the fruit of fine feeling; in
the other, the outcome of inborn lierceness.

3. ou rue saue.

Once a denizen of the woodS,l roamed at freedom‚ but was made to
carry a captive's dire chains. My human-looking face, my many wrinkles
old, touched not my master, nor yet the lact of my being from a foreign
clime. But, beyond my hope, death bursts my chains. My lord was cruel,
but the Fate was kind.
