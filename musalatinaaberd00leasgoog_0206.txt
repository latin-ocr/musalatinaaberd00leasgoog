5. rruuu.

Mulciber fell to earth, not through nugerol Heaven or the 'l'hunderer's
violence. Spontaneously he came to bake bricks lor my mansion, and dis·
carded Jove‘s three-forked levin-holt. The god lame on each foot has a lellow·
feeling lor one lame on both leet, who receives thereby comfort lor his gout
and a pledge os affection. Because ol its perjury, Troy was suffered to sink
in flame, the blue goddess reserves lor him her waters in her cistern.

5. nunnus.

Non gravis ira Deum, non vis magni ulla Tonantis
Praecipitem e caelo Mulciberem egit humi.

Sponte sua, ut lateres coqueret mihi tecta struenti,
Venit, et abiecit tela trisulca lovis.

Scilicet a pedibus capto pede captus utroque, 5
Fomentuin hoc podagrae et pignus amoris habet.

Periuram in flammas passa est considere Troiam,
Huic puteo servans caerula mater aquas.

5. Pedibus capto] Vulcan is the lame god.

6. Jouusrou.

Not a few grey locks overspread your temples: yet Juno never gave
pledges ol offspring to a seeble old man. Who could think that a god carne,
deserting heaven and his kind, to build a nest lor a bird that is barren? Doris,
in letting Troy burn, reserved her waters lor you. When you build in the
Esquiliae of the town, a tremendous flood is needed to cleanse out that den.
