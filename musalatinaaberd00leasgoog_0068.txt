(A Dedication.)

John [Maitland], second Baton Thirlstane and first Earl of Lauderdale‚ died January,
1⁶45· buried at Haddington. (Plura in Masson's william Drummond, p. 447; Sir R. Douglae’s
Peerage, 11. 70.)

ARGUMENT.

I have no gifts to offer, such as Tethys sende from the Red Sea, or ae

dark Indus gathers in his green waters. The fountains 1 draw upon are
those of Phoebus, whence these offerings come, whatever worth may to them
belong. Accept, and, if time allow& inspect, these trifles. An hour will suffice
sor the passing eye. ’Tis the brood of the Eagle that can stand the sun's
bright blaze. Be it thine to show thy heroic blood, nowiee degenerate from
great Maitland in the days of old.
