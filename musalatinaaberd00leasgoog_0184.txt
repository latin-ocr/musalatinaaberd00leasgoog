CXII. ΟΝ THE TWO HAMILTONS‚ THE MARQUIS [OF
HAMILTON] AND EARL OF HADDINGTON.

On these peers‚ see CXIV. 3 and 5. The encomium here must be conlemed to over-
ahoot the mark3 but, though a poet. Johnaton was no prophet, and little discerncd the grim
decapitation scene awaiting the Iormcr [the Marquis] aster Prcston, in March, 1⁶49·

ARGUMENT-

What age can fail to marl< the Hamiltono’ renown‚ a racc that has given
two Phoenixcs¹ to the world? One fulminates victorious in Germany: the
other directs the sceptre ol justice at home. Give back, ye Museo, old
Homer: another Achilles has returned; another wire Ulyasca springs anew
in Scotland.

¹Thia encomium has been applied to Arthur Johncton himself and hia hcother aa two
Phoenixca.

CXII. DE DUOBUS HAMILTONIIS, MARCHIONE ΕΤ
HADINTONIAE COMITE.

Gentis Hamiltoniae laudes quae nesciat aetas,
Phoenices orbi quae dedit una duos?

Hic in T eutonicis iam victor fulminat oria,
Hic patriae, magno sub Iove, iura regit.

Reddite Maeoniden Munae3 redit alter Achilles,
Dat Laertiaden Scotica terra novum.
